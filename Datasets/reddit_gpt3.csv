1,CMV: Tipping culture in the US is getting out of hand and should be discouraged.,"[""There is no one answer to this question as tipping practices vary from one country to the next, but in general, it is generally recommended that tipping be used sparingly, if at all. In some countries, like the US, tipping is becoming more and more common, and this may be leading to a culture of excess where people are expected to give gratuities even if there is no genuine obligation to do so. This can be problematic because it can create an environment of inequality where people are rewarded for favouring those with money over those who don't have it, and it can also create a culture of dependency where people feel obligated to gratify those who have given them help or favor. Ultimately, tipping should be used as a means of thanking someone for a valuable service, not as a way of rewarding someone for simply being nice or generous.""]",gpt3

5,"CMV: If the same Civil Rights protests of 1960s were to happen today, majority of redditors would react very negatively to them.","['There is no doubt that the Civil Rights movement would elicit a very negative reaction from most Redditors today. This is largely because of the advent of social media, which has allowed for a wider range of opinions and perspectives to be expressed. This has led to a climate of intolerance and division, which has made it difficult for people to empathize with different groups of people. Consequently, the Civil Rights movement would likely be met with a lot of hostility and contempt on Reddit.']",gpt3
6,CMV: Opinion-based journalism needs to die,"['There is nothing more frustrating than reading an opinion-based article in any form of media. Most of the time, these pieces lack factual evidence and rely on conjecture to make their case. Moreover, these pieces often lack a nuanced understanding of the topic at hand, which ultimately limits their appeal.\n\nPersonally, I believe that opinion-based journalism is nothing more than a way for sensationalist writers to generate clicks and readers. In recent years, the trend of opinion-based articles has become rampant, which is a clear indication that the industry is in need of a change.\n\nOpinion-based journalism is a redundant form of writing that lacks factual accuracy and doesn’t lend itself to nuanced discussion. As a result, it’s become increasingly unpopular and should be eliminated from the mainstream media.']",gpt3

The study participants who had the strongest grip and forearm strength were less likely to experience pain and disability in the arm area below the shoulder over an 18-month period.

70,My boyfriend and best friend (F) want a threesome.. I need advice,"[""There are a few things to consider before deciding whether or not you want to have a threesome with your boyfriend and best friend. First, some people may feel more comfortable sharing a sexual experience with someone they know well and trust, while others may feel more anonymous and want to explore a new sexual atmosphere with someone they only know somewhat. Second, whether you're the one who is interested in having a threesome or are just inquiring about the experience, it can be helpful to think about what you're looking for in a sexual partner. Are you hoping to find someone who is both experienced and compatible to share a sexual experience with? Or are you hoping to find someone who is simply new to the idea of threesomes, someone who will be enthusiastic and accommodating? Finally, it's important to remember that everyone's individual preferences and experiences will differ, so just because someone else is ready and willing to have a threesome with you doesn't mean that you'll enjoy it or that it will be a good experience for you. If you're unsure about whether or not you are ready to have a threesome or if you just have some general questions about threesomes, it may be best to talk to your boyfriend or best friend about it first before making any decisions.""]",gpt3

We're never taught how to control our anger.\n\nAs kids, we're taught not to hit people, but we're never taught how to express our anger in healthy ways. We're taught to keep our emotions bottled up, and when we can't, our anger turns into rage.\n\n2. We're not properly nurtured.\n\nWhen we're not properly nurtured, we don't learn how to develop healthy relationships or manage our emotions. We don't get the support we need to cope with stress and sadness, and instead, we turn to anger as our go-to solution.\n\n3. We're never given permission to feel anger.\n\nOur society tells us that anger is bad, and that we should never feel it. We're told that we should act happy all the time, and that any anger we feel is wrong. This teaches us to suppress our emotions, which only makes our anger worse.\n\n4. We're constantly bombarded with anger-inducing stimuli.\n\nWe're constantly being exposed to media that anger us, and we're constantly interacting with people who anger us. This can lead to constant rage and frustration, and it's hard to not pick up on that energy.\n\n5. Our anger is never addressed.\n\nWhen we don't express our anger in healthy ways, it festers inside of us. We may not even know that our anger is getting out of control, because we're too afraid to talk about it. But if we don't address it, it will only get worse.""]",gpt3

In the US, housing prices have increased by more than 200% since 2000, but wages have only grown by about 40%. So, while housing prices have increased dramatically, consumption (primarily of housing) has not been supported by strong wage growth.\n\nInstead, the increase in housing prices is a result of a number of factors, including low interest rates and increased demand from Baby Boomers who are retiring. In fact, during the past few years, there has been an overall slowdown in the rate of house-price increases in many other countries, indicating that the US housing market is not unique in this respect.\n\nSo, while there is no doubt that the US housing market is experiencing some extraordinary growth, it is not indicative of a bubble. In fact, the current state of the housing market is actually reflective of a paradigm shift transition towards a highly unequal society.']",gpt3

However, one of the most significant factors is that women are less likely to support female-led or female-owned businesses, teams, and leagues.\n\nThis problem is particularly pronounced in sports, where few women own or run professional teams. As a result, women's salaries are typically lower than those of men in the same position, even when their skills and achievements are equivalent. This is especially true in sports that are traditionally seen as male- dominated, such as baseball and football.\n\nDespite the progress that has been made in recent years, there is still a long way to go before the wage gap in the sports industry is completely closed. In order to encourage more women to participate in sports and support female-led businesses, we need to see real change in the way that the gender wage gap is viewed and addressed.""]",gpt3
