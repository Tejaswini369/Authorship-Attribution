In some countries, like the US, tipping is becoming more and more common, and this may be leading to a culture of excess where people are expected to give gratuities even if there is no genuine obligation to do so. This can be problematic because it can create an environment of inequality where people are rewarded for favouring those with money over those who don't have it, and it can also create a culture of dependency where people feel obligated to gratify those who have given them help or favor.

We're never taught how to control our anger.\n\nAs kids, we're taught not to hit people, but we're never taught how to express our anger in healthy ways. We're taught to keep our emotions bottled up, and when we can't, our anger turns into rage.\n\n2. We're not properly nurtured.\n\nWhen we're not properly nurtured, we don't learn how to develop healthy relationships or manage our emotions. We don't get the support we need to cope with stress and sadness, and instead, we turn to anger as our go-to solution.\n\n3. We're never given permission to feel anger.\n\nOur society tells us that anger is bad, and that we should never feel it. We're told that we should act happy all the time, and that any anger we feel is wrong. This teaches us to suppress our emotions, which only makes our anger worse.\n\n4. We're constantly bombarded with anger-inducing stimuli.\n\nWe're constantly being exposed to media that anger us, and we're constantly interacting with people who anger us. This can lead to constant rage and frustration, and it's hard to not pick up on that energy.\n\n5. Our anger is never addressed.\n\nWhen we don't express our anger in healthy ways, it festers inside of us. We may not even know that our anger is getting out of control, because we're too afraid to talk about it. But if we don't address it, it will only get worse.""]",True

So yeah hope this update makes someone’s day because it certainly made mine. Have a great day.

Also made a typo I’m 15 not 16 lol","I (30f) have been married to my husband (45m) for 5 years and together for 8. Obviously we have an age gap in our relationship and whenever we discussed possible health issues or medical care, it was regarding him. 

About four months ago, I was in a car accident. I was talking on Bluetooth to my husband because I was nervous driving on the icy roads going to our house, when another car rounded a corner too fast and lost control. It was one of those “exact wrong moment” things and my car went off the road and into a tree. My husband heard the whole thing and my last memory before I lost consciousness was him screaming my name. 

I don’t want to get into the bloody details, but I ended up being in the hospital for over a month. I needed multiple surgeries and have been in physical therapy ever since. I am finally getting to a point where I feel like myself again and am no longer in pain. I’ve gained back some weight and look good if I do say so myself. 

My husband literally worked out of my hospital room for the entire time I was there. He went home to shower, sleep and look after the dogs, then came right back. He attended all my therapy appointments so he would know how to better help me recover at home. He was amazing and everything I could ask him to be in that kind of horrible situation. I love him so much and so yesterday while shopping, I saw this gorgeous black lingerie set and decided to surprise him. We haven’t had sex since before the accident and every time I try, it feels like he makes an excuse or expresses some concern about some random body part of mine that is no longer injured. 

He was on his laptop in bed when I came in wearing my new purchases and I could tell he was taken by surprise. I basically crawled into his lap and started kissing his neck and grinding on him. He was definitely hard but then he lost it and pushed me away, saying that we shouldn’t rush this and he doesn’t want to jeopardize my recovery with sex. I was crying by the time he ended the sentence and said “I’m fine! The doctors say sex is fine!” But he was already walking into the bathroom and turning on the shower. 

I don’t know what to think. Is it the scars? Is the memory of me in a hospital bed unable to even sit up by myself repelling him? I finally am starting to feel good about myself and my body again and the fact that he won’t touch me is really hurting my mental health. It’s probably a long shot but has anyone else experienced this?

TL;DR: I was in a major car accident and I’m finally back to myself but my husband doesn’t want to have sex with me.

Update: 

Thank you again for everyone’s kind and thoughtful comments, I read all of them even if I didn’t respond. Last night when we got in bed I curled up next to my husband and held him while I said basically “we’ve been through a lot, would you be willing to get therapy with me to make sure everything is alright for both of us? I love you so much and I don’t want any underlying trauma to effect our relationship.”

He was silent for about ten second and then the floodgates opened. I’ve only seen him cry once or twice in our entire relationship (at our wedding and the first time I told him I loved him), but I held him while he sobbed for what was probably an hour. He kept apologizing for it and I had to keep saying “don’t be sorry, I’m here, cry if you need to cry.” And I shed some tears of my own. 

It was an exhausting but ultimately extremely cathartic experience. When it was all over and he was able to say more than a few words, he told me that there was about 15 minutes when he was sure he had just heard the love of his life die, then we got to the hospital and the doctors made it clear they would do everything they could but the extent of my injuries were extreme and severe. Then he spent hours calling family members, waiting, pacing and trying to grapple with the fact that I might die and he might be alone. Then I spent five days in the ICU, mostly unconscious. He said he’s never known fear like that in his life. 

In the end we agreed to go to individual and couple’s therapy and even touched on the sex thing, wherein he admitted that he knows objectively nothing bad will happen to me if we have sex but for some reason it is sparking this protective instinct that makes him want to treat me like glass. 

So we’re working on it, and our marriage is amazing. He’s the love of my life and we can get through this.",True
101,101,"15F here. So a little over 3 weeks ago my parents told my brother (9M) and I that they were going out for a while to see some friends and May end up spending the night somewhere. Didn’t really think much of it at the time and but they haven’t been home since and I’m not sure what to do.

They’re not missing. I’ve texted both of them multiple times now and they always respond, and I’ve even FaceTimed my mom several times and it’s definitely her and she seems totally okay. But when I ask them where they are or when they think they’ll be coming home they just sort of avoid the question. 

I’m starting to get really worried, especially since they now saying I should use their credit card they left here to like, buy groceries if I need to, which I’m taking to mean they’re not coming back for at least another week.

I have no idea what to do. Do I call the police? Again they’re not missing, they just won’t come back home for some reason. But my brother is starting to get worried now too. If anyone has any advice please do share it because I’ve never been this confused in my life

UPDATE - I posted this update earlier as it’s own post, but it was removed as updates are supposed to be added to the original text unless they are asking for additional advice, which mine was not. Here’s the original update however:

Hey everyone. I just wanted to make this post so that you all know what’s going on now and that we’re okay.

My grandparents are here at the house with us now. They called back as soon as they got the voicemails I left and immediately started heading this way. I feel a lot better now that they are here. They called the police once they got here. They talked to them, I talked to them. All that we really did is tell them everything I said in the original post I made and showed them my texts with them. We don’t have much more information then that.

My grandpa called our dad and I think he actually spoke to one of the police officers. I don’t know what he said though, other than he still won’t tell anybody where they are. So we still have no idea what they’re doing or why they left. I promise I’ll make another update when I know more. Please have patience though. I’m trying to cooperate with an investigation now. They’re bringing the police dogs over to sniff around the house and I’m so nervous and I don’t even know why.

Hi everyone. First of all, I want to say I was absolutely blown away by the outpouring of love and support I received on my first post. I never could have imagined it would blow up like that and I received so many thoughtful and kind comments and messages from strangers. 

That being said, when I wrote that, I was in a weird place. Physically I had mostly healed but I was determined to shove down any emotional trauma because I was so exhausted from the previous months of work trying to heal my body. I wanted to be alright, and I wanted my marriage to be the same as it was before the accident. 

My husband and I just attended our third marriage counseling appointment and I’m very happy to report the exercises and worksheets we’ve been given are helping rebuild the husband/wife relationship instead of the caregiver/patient relationship which has been present for the last 5 months. My husband just had his first individual therapy appointment a few days ago and I have mine next week. In short, we’re putting in the work. 

We’re also having sex again! Like, *a lot* of sex! I feel silly bragging about that to the internet at large, but it makes me so happy that we’ve figured out that part of all this. Prior to the accident and really throughout our whole relationship we’ve been so ridiculously into each other, it was rare we even skipped a day. I missed having that connection to him and he was clearly hurting too. 

Anyway. I just thought everyone deserved an update ♥️♥️♥️♥️


TL:Dr- we’re getting better!",True
102,102,"I, 28f, am currently 19 weeks pregnant. My partner, 29M, and I are very excited, as this is our first baby and we have been trying for a few months.

We announced the pregnancy a month ago at a dinner party we hosted, and everyone seemed surprised and overjoyed. My sister, 35f, who I will call K, immediately burst into tears and asked me how I could do this to her. I stared at her, and asked “What?” She started ranting, saying that I always got everything I wanted (which is not true, I worked hard for all that I have) and that she knew I got pregnant just so I could rub her infertility in her face.

She screamed at me for 5 minutes about how I didn’t deserve to be a mother and she should be the one pregnant right now. My parents left with her soon after, and the party was basically over. I was really disturbed by my sister's reaction, because we had been pretty close before, and she had never done anything like this.

K called me the next day, apologizing for how she acted at my announcement and asked if we could meet up for coffee. I accepted. We met up and she pretended as nothing had happened. Then she started a big speech about her infertility, how heartbreaking it is to be growing life inside of her, just to lose it, and how she had always wanted children of her own. She then proceeded to ask me if I could consider getting an abortion, to make things “fair”, or letting her adopt my baby. I stared at her and asked if she was serious. K said she was. I just dropped my part of the bill on the table and left.

L texted me a rant that night about how I’d made K cry, and how all they wanted was to be parents, and that this meant so much to them, and I “owed” them for being more successful than them. I and my partner invested many years into our jobs, and we have worked very hard to earn what we earn now. I told them that my partner and I had been hoping for kids too and that I was not giving up my baby. He hung up.

She later sent me a long letter (4 pages) about how she had always wanted to be a mother, and could I consider either abortion or letting her adopt my baby, how I should care about my older sister's happiness, how she would make a better mum, how the oldest kid should have the first grandchild, and how I could always just have another baby since it was ""so easy for me to conceive"".

After that, she quieted down some, and I thought we were done with this. Except... it wasn't. She had posted MY SONOGRAM on her FB, and captioned it “L and I are expecting! We can’t wait to meet our little princess!”

I was seeing red. I texted her and demanded she takes the post down. No reply.\`\` I texted L. No reply. So I called my mother and told her what happened. She was able to make K take the post down, luckily enough. K has called me petty for calling my mum and has continued to demand I give up my baby. I sent her a letter explaining that I had had enough of her nonsense, I AM keeping my baby, and that I recommend she get some help. I added that if she continues, I will not hesitate to call 999.

This weekend, however, was the absolute last straw. My mum and dad have the spare key to my house, and while she was over at their house for brunch, she took the key. While my partner and I were at work, she broke into our house and stole all the clothing, blankets, nappies, bottles, and pretty much any other item we had bought for the baby, except furniture. It was later returned after my mum found it in her car. I called 999, but they told me I couldn't do anything because I had no proof and because it was all returned.

My partner and I are moving in April, but I'm still scared my sister will find out where we live and take my child. I get that she's upset and jealous, due to her infertility, but that shouldn't mean I have to give up my baby. My parents know about this, and they have been doing their best to get her some help. She doesn't want to adopt, because she wants a child that's her own flesh and blood. I'm due in August, and the stress she's causing cannot and will not be good for me or the baby. My partner is looking into a cease-and-desist letter. Is there anything else I should do or say? I'm scared for my baby.

**UPDATE 28-3-22**

The support I've received from this website is overwhelming! Thank you all for your comments, although I couldn't reply to all of them, they are appreciated! We have had the locks changed, cameras installed, and a Ring doorbell. I've started saving every letter and screenshotting every message my sister has sent and plan to take them to court for a restraining order very soon. We have also been seriously documenting everything.

My husband and I are planning a trip to Ireland for our anniversary next week, and it's going to be good to clear our heads from my sister. I've called 999 to report her for harassment, and they gave her a warning. She's contacted me saying that if I won't give her my child, I can at least pay for multiple rounds of IVF, which I have not replied to other than refusing. She's been begging my parents to convince me to give up my baby, which they refuse to do. They have also been given a statement that basically says that if they give her my contact information, they will not see my baby, to which they have agreed.

I've since changed my phone number, and we are moving very soon. My sister does not know our new address. She actually stood on our stoop for 20 minutes a few days ago, banging on our door, and yelling. My husband opened a window and told her that if she didn't leave, he would let the dog out, and threatened to call the police. We have a rather small, but hyper puppy who jumps on everyone and barks a lot, and she is quite scared of dogs, actually, so this made her leave. I started working from home last week, as did my husband, and we've followed the advice of one of the comments, washed all of the baby stuff, as well as made sure none of the food in our kitchen was messed with (none was, luckily).

We're planning on getting a restraining order as soon as possible, and are looking forward to our trip! I'm already sick of being pregnant, and I'm not even in the third trimester. I just want my baby.

My mom invited Jin over to dinner and it turns out they kept all their mushy stuff on my mom's smartphone, I knew they were friends but turns out half the time my mom's 'gone out to dinner with a friend' lately it's been Jin.

My mom hadn't told me for a few reasons. She grew up in a super conservative area and was kinda forced to marry my dad right after high school. She's not sure if she's bi or gay or has an exception or what, she's still working through a lot of stuff about how she feels and what she wants to call herself.

She also didn't want to tell me until I turned 18 because she's pretty sure my grandparents and aunts and uncles will disown her when she comes out, and make me choose. My mom wanted to wait until I was legally an adult and could make my own decisions about my relationships with my family. 

I hugged my mom and told her I don't give a shit what some hateful, miserable antediluvian cretins yammering from the primordial ooze say, she's my mom and she's awesome and I love her and Jin seems like a great woman. I told her that if the crabs in the bucket want to pull her back down, make crab cakes with rainbow sprinkles.

Jin laughed her head off but my mom asked me to please not say anything in public. She's working through personal shit and she'll come out in public when she's ready, so I promised I wouldn't say a word to anyone.

Except to you guys, there was so much awesome advice. Thank you, reddit!

EDIT: To whom it concerns, 'Kim' and 'Jin' are of course not their real names, and I've fudged how long my mom's known these people for.

103,103,"Last year, my husband discovered Destiny’s Child. I don’t know how he wasn’t aware of them before, but that’s beside the point. He obviously didn’t have this obsession before we were married. In fact, we have been married for 7 years, and he’d never exhibited any signs of obsessive behavior before this. Now, his obsession is taking over both of our lives and costing us a lot of money.
He spends all day on eBay bidding on Destiny’s Child merch. He is always the highest bidder, so it’s very expensive. He is only subscribed to streaming services so he can listen to them. He bought a Bluetooth shower speaker so he can listen to them while he bathes.
We cannot have one conversation without him saying something like, “You know, this actually reminds me of a Destiny’s Child lyric.”
He’s spent hours watching YouTube tutorials, learning the choreography from every video. He makes me sit down and watch him dance in front of the TV to make sure his form and timing are perfect.
He emails the members often, begging them for a reunion tour. He has also sent them birthday gifts in the mail. I would like to point out that his obsession is not sexual in any way— he just thinks they’re really cool. 
I’m almost to my wit’s end. I feel like I can’t escape Destiny’s Child and have lost my husband completely to this obsession.
Any advice would be greatly appreciated.

Update: My husband had an MRI yesterday. He reluctantly agreed to it, because he knew I was absolutely terrified and anxious. No tumor, thank goodness. Everything was normal. He is finally beginning to understand how seriously I take this and how much of a problem it’s become in our marriage. He has agreed to visit a therapist. Hoping for the best! Thank you all for your wonderful advice, it means the world.","Using a throwaway just in case.

My mom (36F) has raised me as a single mom since my piece of shit dad ran off to marry some chick he met on deployment. She has worked very hard and I love her to bits. She's never talked about remarrying and has never even dated to my knowledge.

Two years ago she met Kim at one of my swim meets and they became instant friends. I found it kind of annoying at first, but the last couple years she's been happier than I ever remember my mom being. They go out to dinner once a week, they talk and text a lot, etc. 

Earlier this week I had to fix a software problem on my mom's computer and I opened her browser history and saw a page about having safe sex for two women. All of a sudden everything clicked. My mom working late hours at work a lot recently, my mom hiding her laundry from me, things like that.

I want to tell my mom that I'm really happy for her that she has a girlfriend and she doesn't have to hide it from me, but I feel like going 'Hey mom, I know you're munching Kim's rug' wouldn't be good. 

Advice?

[UPDATE]: Lots of really good advice! We both have Monday off so I'll come up with something to say to her then.

104,104,"Been with my girlfriend for 6 months, things are going well, she does get jealous at times but I think a lot of girls do. Had a vacation booked with my friends since before we met to Cancun. 

First day I get there and it is crazy hot, I have pale skin so I always wear factor 50 sunscreen so I don’t burn. I was laid out in the sun for about 6 hours, in pool and sea. Didn’t feel burnt, then when I got back to the hotel I started to feel sick and my body was red all over. I was sick and stayed in the hotel that evening In agony, could barely walk from being so burnt.

Messaged my girlfriend and said what had happened, I thought the uv was just super intense and I burnt. She replied with the cry laugh emoji 😂 she said that she swapped out my factor 50 and replaced it with factor 2 for a joke. 

I haven’t spoken to her for 4 days now and am only just recovering from my sunburn and able to walk normally as my legs were very burnt. I am now peeling though. Haven’t left hotel room at all, just had friends bring me food while they went out and partied.

Not sure what to do, is this something to break up over or am I overreacting?

I feel she did this as she was jealous I’d be hooking up with other girls whilst away from her.","I finally dumped his ass over text (I would normally do it in person but I did not want to be gaslighted again) after he literally changed our whole group activity plans because of his ""marriage material"" best girlfriend and proceeded to yell at me for not hanging out with him because I had prior plans which I invited him to as well. He tries to gaslight and manipulate me and I'm not taking his shit anymore. He is absolutely in love with her and I hope one day he can come to terms with his feelings just leave me the fuck alone.

I have found out that my mother never really abandoned me because she didn\`t want me, but because she tried to commit suicide and was deemed unfit to parent and that my father basically baby trapped my mother with me.

After the post yesterday, I went snooping even more because I do not trust my father anymore.

I found records of domestic abuse perpetrated by my father toward my mother. He was charged but never ended up going to jail or did a very reduced sentence. This would have been when I was 2 after my mother was committed. I also found a Restraining Order filed by my mother against my father.

It was so much worse than what she said. He did not only abuse her emotionally but also physically. I am feeling so disgusted. I could just scream.

I returned to my boyfriend again. My father has been calling a lot asking why I had spent so much time away from home.

RN my excuse is a family emergency of my boyfriend.

So I (21F) decided to break up with my bf (22M) of 7 months and some change. The car incident was just one among many other things. I was very much in love with him so I forgave many things like constantly being told I was unintelligent and helpless, being treated roughly, him holding me by my arm and pinching it because he was mad at me, stonewalling, being yelled at and cursed at, him saying he felt like cheating on me. The breakup was really hard because I cared so much about him and he didn’t take it well. It’s crazy because in the moment it felt so hard but literally the day after I felt so relieved! I feel so free, like I can be myself again. I had been struggling with this constant feeling of anxiety the past few months and since I broke up with him I have not felt that way again! Thank you all for the heartfelt advice and tough love. To all of you please remember to not let your feelings for someone cloud your judgement!

I (27M) wasn't sure about doing an update post but quite a few of you gave me some good advice ( and some didn't but I want to focus on the good ones) so I thought it would be fair to update you on how the situation evolved.

After reading your advices, I decided to meet Nina (27F) for that coffee. It was awkward but it wasn't that bad. She apologized profusely about the past. I thought her apologies would make me feel good but to be honest, I was wrong. The truth is that I still think badly of the Nina who bullied me in middle school but I couldn't see that Nina in the current Nina ( I don't know if what I'm trying to say makes sense or if my brain finally decided to give up on me.). Her voice, her demeanor, everything except for her face is completely different.

I told her exactly how what she and the other bullies did affected me and then I decided to forgive her... more or less.

I decided to start over as strangers and told her as much. I told her that while I couldn't forget what she did in the past, I don't know the current Nina. It's been 14 years since the those times, more than half of our lives passed since then and I firmly believe people can change ( I did.) so, if she wanted to try and get to know the current me, we could act as if that was the first time we met and move on from then. I don't know if this decision show my maturity or my stupidity, I guess the future will tell.

I admit what she did next made my giggle a bit ( I think she took it from a film but I don't remember which one.). She stood up and got out of the coffee shop, then came back in, sat down and introduced herself.

We chatted for a bit and it was ok.

I what to thank all the people who gave me advices in the comment section of the previous post.

2 1/2 - 3 months ago, my mom stopped going grocery shopping, and only on some days would her ex go out and buy ingredients to cook with.

Originally, I thought it has to do with a bad financial situation, until she told me outright that she was simply too lazy.

My heart is still racing. Did I do the right thing in saying no?","I (36M) have 2 siblings, Lena (28F) and Mark (26M). I have been taking care of them for most of my life.

When I was 20, our parents died in an accident and I had to step up to take care of Mark and Lena. We didn't have any close relative, except for our grandma, who was too sick to take care care of us.

I retired from university and got a job. Somehow we managed to survive, thanks to my work, our parents' inheritance and our grandma, who sent us money sometime.

While they were growing up, there were many times I believed we couldn't keep living like that but I always tried to not show I was worried in front of them and to act as if everything was fine.

When Lena was 17, she decided she wanted to be a doctor like our father. I don't know how we managed to pay for her university ( it was a joint effort of me, Lena, Mark and grandma)  but she was able to graduate. Grandma had been stuck in bed since I was 18 but she did the impossible to come to Lena's graduation ceremony. She basically came on a wheelchair with her doctor on one side and me on the other.

Mark loves flower since he was little and always said he wanted to work in a flower shop. That's exactly what he is doing now. It's not thrilling but it's a good job where he is able to do what he likes, so I'm happy for him.

Lena got married 2 years ago with Tom. He is a bit too innocent but all in all he is a good man.

I work for a moving company. The salary is not the best but now that Lena and Mark are independent, it's enough to live my life and I'm slowly paying back my debts. I can't afford many luxuries but I don't care about that. I'm not a fancy person; as long as I'm healthy and I have a roof over my head and a book in my hands, I'm happy.

Unfortunately my siblings don't agree with my way of thinking. They feel guilty because I couldn't go to college and couldn't get a better job and they blame themselves for this. I have told them a thousand of times that I don't care about that anymore and that I'm just happy they could achieve their dreams and live a comfortable life.

In the past 2 years I was able to convince them to let it go.

Recently, though, I had a minor accident. Nothing serious, a desk fell on my hand and I broke two fingers. The doctor said they will heal in a couple of months.

Unfortunately, this made Lena and Mark worry again about me.

Lena wants me to go live with her and her husband and Mark wants me to work in his flower shop.

I don't want to be a burden to them, I don't want to interfere in my sister's wedding and I don't want my brother to give me a job out of pity.

How can I convince them I'm fine with my life and just want them to be happy and move on with their lives?

TL;DR : I took care of my siblings since they were little. Now they insist on ""making things even"" by taking care of me. I don't want that.

110,110,"Hey, so I was on a walk around 1pm today and saw this little girl walking by herself in her pj’s. I stopped and asked if she was ok and she said she couldn’t find her mom. So I asked her if she could take me to her house and I would try and help her. We get to her house and walk in and the mom is there dead. I brought the girl outside and called 911 and they asked me if I could do CPR and I said no she’s cold and has no pulse. It was a really horrible scene to see. The police got there quickly and I stayed with the girl for a bit. Neighbours started coming up who knew the girl and talked with her. I left to get the girl some snacks and some of my daughters clothes as they were the same age and she was in filthy pj’s and hadn’t eaten all day. The girl said her mom was like that when she woke up so she had been in the house with her dead mother for like 5-6 hours, it was just awful. I left when children’s aid showed up and went and get a few toys for the girl. She was very happy with them when I brought them for her. She didn’t seem to really understand what had happened I don’t think.

I recently started seeing this guy who has been in the friendzone for four years. We are genuinely friends but he Actively tried to sleep with me before. Before we started seeing each other, I had concerns because he has Peter Pan syndrome and is inherently self motivated in the way he approaches women. He never wants to commit, I really don't want to date him. I just wanted a fuck buddy. We had a very long talk where I expressed my concerns and he said he would make a conscious effort if I gave him a chance. He told me has an issue with porn and that's where he learned about sex. I repeatedly mentioned that mutual pleasure and being present during sex is really important to me. I also told him that sexual compatibility is equally important  and we discussed what that meant in great detail. 


We had sex. Well it felt more like he masturbated with my body more than anything. This man has no inherent understanding how to pleasure a woman.   He pulled my tits out of my bra the way you see in porn, never went near them except to titty fuck me. He never touched my clit, didn't really warm me up besides this very unpleasant fingering where he pried open my legs and essentially windshield wiped my vaginal walls to ""hear how wet"" I was while insisting on head. I repeatedly tried giving instructions. He pulled out of me twice to make me suck him off so he didn't have to nut in a condom. I spent more time with this man's dick in my mouth (30 min/45 min total) than he spent inside my body. Then after he came twice, he asked me how he would know if I came. Told him I don't really orgasm from penetration alone, so he pulled up his pants and said ""oh, but I finished."" 

He reached out today asking me to come over again but honestly I have no desire to do that again. How do I tell him that I don't want to sleep with him again? And if I do, do I share the concerns above? Will this end our friendship?


EDIT; 
I don’t want anything from him. Just to go back to the friends part. Like I want to revert the fuck buddy back to just buddy. I was horny and he was available and I genuinely like spending time with him as friends. He's the biggest commitment phobe and is undatable. Just sad he is also unfuckable. I wish I didn't break the platonic boundary. However as his friend I also think he needs to know that if he is going to be a forever bachelor he should at least know how to make those women orgasm.

I’m wondering if I should move her up another. She first moved from third to fourth grade, then forth to fifth, then fifth to sixth. 

The next grade will be seventh which is the start of Highschool. I’m worried that she’s way too young and will get picked on, but she (and her teachers) insist that she’s more than ready. 

I’m scared my baby will get trampled because she’s only nine, but at the same time I want her to learn at the level she fits. In her grade now she’s bored because she knows everything. 

What should I do?

So it’s been about a month, and I thought I should update as a talking things out with commenters really pushed me into realising that the relationship desperately needed help.

I asked him to do couples therapy with me, and although hesitant at first he agreed to give it a go. I found a provider, we had a look through profiles and chose one together, and then sent in our expression of interest within an hour of my asking. She responded two days later, and we had our first session booked in for the end of the week.

Knowing he was hesitant, we gave the TV show ‘Couples Therapy’ a go, accidentally starting on season 2 which I think may have been a blessing in disguise as those couples made a lot of positive progress. This ended up being a really good idea! My partner was far more open to therapy when we started and really threw himself into it, and it actually helped me to start identify to some of my problems (looking at Michal’s anxiety there, although minus the anger and aggression towards her partner).

I’m not going to go into detail with the stuff that came out, but even after just two sessions we understand each other so much better. We’ve got a lot of work to do to overcome things, but just understanding where our behaviours come from goes a really long way to wiping out the resentment, and helping us connect and communicate.

It’s safe to say we’re both carrying childhood trauma, which I think I was less aware of on my side. Like I knew my family dynamic wasn’t necessarily healthy growing up, and I have a complicated relationship with my parents as an adult, but I didn’t realise how much baggage it had left me with. 

I feel more comfortable going into things from my side, so I guess I’ll talk a bit about that. I never really had any safe attachments growing up, and I struggle a lot with feeling safe in relationships (both romantic and platonic), and with trust. I didn’t even realise! I thought struggling with vulnerability and the way that manifests for me was completely rational and normal, but in retrospect of course it isn’t. 

So some commenters suggesting that maybe I was overreacting, or that maybe it wasn’t just about the one situation, you were right! Just maybe not in the way you were expecting. It wasn’t just about the financial advisor, it was about two adults with childhood trauma trying to be better people together who needed a bit of help.

I know this is very vague on things from my partners side, but that is not really for me to share. I am however incredibly proud of him for opening up in the way that he has, and I’ve learnt so much about him as a person that he’s struggled to talk about before. Therapy has reaffirmed that he is the person I want to spend my life with, and has shown me that we’re both willing to put in the work to make that happen.

I’m excited about where this journey will take us, and about the future we can build together. We’re a great team and a great couple in a lot of ways, and the support we’ve been able to give each other as we’ve begun digging into our respective traumas has made me feel really positive about the relationship and where we’re going, and that the things we’re struggling with are things that we can overcome together (with a little help from our wonderful therapist of course).

Tl;dr We started couples therapy and it was the best idea I’ve ever had. I will recommend therapy to everyone I meet for the rest of my life. I still have not learnt to not use long, run-on sentences.",True
112,112,"Jess 23f and I have been together for two years and she never liked my mom and with good reason because my mom is an alcoholic. My sister was placed into my care not too long ago. If I had not taken her, she would have been placed in the system. Jess never liked the idea and if I did not know any better, I would say that she was disappointed when I made the decision.

She wants us to have a baby and has been very vocal about it especially since my sister moved in. I am not particularly ready because I have a lot of responsibilities so it does not seem possible at the moment. I am juggling work and college on top of taking care of my sister. Jess still does not seem to understand that but I brushed it off as normal relationship differences.

Last night I worked night shift and this morning, my sister was not herself at all. I took her out for ice cream and  tried getting her to talk and she eventually tearfully told me that she knows that I don't want her here. I asked her what gave her that idea and she explained to me that my fiance was telling her that we will soon have a baby of our own and start our own real family because that is what adults do. 

There wouldn't be enough space for her because her room is supposed to be the baby's nursery so she might have to be taken back to my mom. I was so livid for many reasons but I tried not to show my sister. My mom was a functioning  alcoholic but got worse a while after I left home. Maybe because I took care of everything and everyone so now she had to be an actual parent. Anyway she would leave my sister alone for a day or two to go see her boyfriend. My sister would eventually have to call me and tell me the truth once the food ran out so I would have to drop everything and go down there. She generally tried to hide my mom's bad parenting.

She told  me the day I took her was the happiest day of her life and I have a very pink thank you bracelet to prove it. So it made me very mad to hear that Jess told her that she would go back. I explained to her that I want her here and nothing would ever change that. She has nothing to worry about and that Jess did not mean anything she said. She is not usually mean so it's so confusing for me.

My sister normally worships the ground Jess walks on but has been avoiding her today. I asked Jess about it and she did not deny. She said that my sister is not our responsibility and that she is ruining our plans to start a real family. I told her that my sister is in fact my responsibility and real family. I have no intentions of having a baby with her or get married if she can't respect that.

She freaked out and started shouting and calling my sister names saying it's all her fault. My sister must have heard because it's a tiny apartment. Because of this, I told her that she needs to leave my place and go calm down. We were planning on eloping but it's definitely off the books now.

Did I make the right decision? And how do I reassure my sister especially after she heard what Jess said about her?","Boyfriend and I have been together for 6 years, work our day jobs together, and also run a side business together. He's my best friend, and despite managing to get past and through a lot together, he hasn't proposed. His family is starting to pressure us to get married, but he said he hasn't decided yet. He has said that he wants to get married and have a ton of kids, so what he means is, he hasn't decided if he wants to marry me.

My ego is a little hurt. What else does he need to know that he hasn't already learned in almost 7 years? Is indecision the same thing as a decision in this case?

We both started therapy separately very recently to work through some trauma and cope with anxiety. I don't know if I should wait to see if he'll come to come kind of epiphany in therapy, or if I should leave and save the decision for him. I love him a lot, and for a long time I saw a future with him, but recently I'm starting to accept signs that he just doesn't love me as much as I love him. How do I know if he loves me or if he just doesn't want to be alone?

TLDR; After nearly 7 years, and pressure from his family, he still does not know if he wants to marry me. Should I stay? Does he even love me? If you love someone don't you want to be with them? I don't understand why this is so complicated.

Edited to add:

Wow this really popped off. Thank you everyone for your well-meaning advice. To clear some things up:

-we don't live together, we won't live together until we are married. He has stayed over for extended periods of time, so we're mostly familiar with each other's habits.

-we are from different cultures, but I still come from a traditional family so we have a lot of the same values. I just consider myself to be more independent.

-i am very uncomfortable with the idea of an ultimatum. I don't like the idea of forcing someone to make a decision out of fear or because theyre backed into a corner. 

-My communication skills are something that I'm pretty proud of, to be honest, but it's something that he struggles with, and that's one thing he wants to work on in therapy. I'm working on not projecting my fears of insecurity onto our relationship, even when he isn't communicating properly.


Right after I posted this, we had a gig so he picked me up and I told him that after the conversation with his family, I've been feeling really insecure in our relationship, and if he's unsure if he wants to marry me, I need to know what he's unsure about. I said if we want to have kids, I really can't wait forever. He says that he is sure he wants to marry me, and he might have had a plan to propose, but when I came over his family completely blindsided him, and now it's awkward, like they've spoiled it. I told him maybe he needs to think about if what we have is what he wants. I just feel it shouldn't be this complicated. I wanted to move in 

together two years in, but we couldn't because we weren't married. Ok, so marry me then? Why wait almost 5 more years? Something always comes up. Maybe I'm just jaded and bitter at this point and nothing will make me happy. I do believe him, he wouldn't drag me along just for the fun of it. I love him, and our lives are so wrapped up, it's very hard to leave, even if I wanted to. I just wish I could read his mind.




Edit 2: Kind of a half update? 

I didn't want to make a new post, I just wanted to let everyone know what's going on, mostly for all the sweet DM's I got from people who could relate to my situation, so thank you for all the well meaning advice!

I wanted to talk to my therapist before I made any decisions. We both had appointments the following day and in my session she asked me if I thought I was ready for marriage. I said ""of course, I've known I wanted to marry him since I asked him to move out with me, two years into the relationship and he turned me down."" She responded by rephrasing the question. She said she isn't asking if I want to marry him, but rather, is the way I currently feel about myself, the way I handle my problems and my anxiety, and the way my boyfriend and I communicate - is the way I feel in my relationship the way I want the rest of my life with this man to be? ""No way"" came out of my mouth way before I even processed it. ""STRESSED"" was in my brain in big, bold, yellow letters. 

Right now I need to continue to work on my issues in therapy and learn what the best version of myself is like before I'm ready to commit to whatever future version of our lives together looks like. I've only been going for two months so far, and I've already seen a huge improvement in my ability to handle stress and my self worth. I REALLY STRONGLY recommend therapy to everyone, if it's an option for you, even if you think there's nothing wrong and you have a perfectly peachy life. It's like taking a class on how to be a better you.

He's been going for about a month and he's surprised by how much it's helped him, too. At his session, they talked about how how his own parents traumatic divorce is creating a huge block for him in a lot of areas in his life and is the root of a lot of his anxiety. Right now it's nice to be able to support each other, and to be able to create personal goals outside of our (semi-codependent) relationship.

Thanks again for everyone's advice. Maybe I'll make a real update if something actually happens, like a break up or a proposal. But for now, I'll focus on my personal growth and he'll focus on his, and we'll continue to support each other until we're both ready to focus on us.",True
113,113,"My wife, 46, has been battling cancer for 4 1/2 years. She was admitted to a hospice yesterday and we’ve been by her side. It’s also our youngest daughter’s birthday today. My oldest, 16, got to say goodbye last night and my middle, 13, is home with the flu and could not be admitted to say her final goodbyes.  We were able to have my wife come home from hospital last week until yesterday so some time was spent with her by all 3 of my kids. Losing a parent so young, on her birthday has me deeply worried for her mental health and future enjoyment of her day. I’m hoping for some advice on how to approach and manage this terrible circumstance. Thank you in advance.

Follow up: 
My wife passed away today at 10:25am with myself, her mom, dad and sister by her side. It was so sad. She had suffered so much since being diagnosed. Thank you everyone for responding. Many of the reply’s brought tears to my eyes.","I need help navigating this awkward situation.

A coworker threw a party at his house over the weekend and I found out from other coworkers who were invited. ""Dan"" and I started working together earlier this year when he joined our department. We aren't on the same team but often will hang out at lunch or at the bar after hours with everyone else. We aren't super close, but we are pretty friendly, at least on the same level as others who were invited to the party.

Yesterday a coworker I am close with pulled me aside and told me she felt bad but she and others were invited to Dan's house over the weekend for a small party. It wasn't coworkers only and Dan and his wife's friends from outside of work were the majority. I was a bit hurt I wasn't invited and asked if she knew why and if I had done something to upset Dan. She told me that it was the general consensus that Dan's wife didn't like me hanging around him at work or happy hour and that I apparently give her ""homewrecker vibes"". She overheard the wife telling her friend this at the party in a different room from the main area and eavesdropped a bit. The wife said it was weird that I follow him on instagram and like all his posts when he doesn't follow me back. I was mortified by this, I follow other coworkers too and they follow me back so I guess I just assumed Dan had as well. Her friend apparently then asked if the wife was worried that I would see photos of the party to which his wife responded ""What? I can't have a party in my own house with my husband without inviting her? She doesn't spend enough time with him every lunch or happy hour? Maybe now she will get the hint and f\*ck off. ""

I don't have any feelings for Dan beyond work friendliness but now I feel like I've done something wrong and I'm being made out to be this office hussy. I unfollowed him from social media after my coworker told me this and got lunch with some other people yesterday. I still said hi and such when I saw him and we were both polite. He didn't mention the party and I didn't mention what I was told. I can't figure out what it was that ticked his wife off. We don't hang out one on one and it's always with other coworkers both male and female. I don't understand why I'm being singled out. I just want my work environment to be a friendly one and this sort of situation is causing me to feel stress and hypervigilant of my interactions at work now.

It seems like there's some undercurrent in our department now where people noticed I wasn't invited and are now making silent assumptions like they think I did something improper involving Dan. I walked into our snack lounge and three of the women who were there stopped talking abruptly and just gave me really forced greetings.

What should I do to diffuse this situation? My natural instinct is to talk to Dan but I feel that this would get back to his wife and cause more drama. A close friend suggested I just disentangle myself from him completely and only interact with him on work-related things. I just want to avoid any more drama.

**Edit:** Hey everyone, I want to say thank you for the huge response this got. I appreciate all the different kinds of input I've gotten, even if they were opposing views, it's good to get different perspectives because for all I know any one of them could be what his wife is thinking. I wanted to clarify some things:

\-My coworker who told me about it has been a good friend for the 3 years we've been at this company. I don't think she told me with the intent of making me feel bad or spreading gossip, just more of a heads up sort of thing. As far as I know, she hasn't told anyone else, but it doesn't mean other coworkers at the party didn't find out and talk to people.

\-A lot of people are asking if I'm attractive/more attractive than the wife. I think his wife is very pretty and have heard others say so as well. She is slender and has some very classic Audrey Hepburn features. I don't think I'm ugly, but I am a little heavier than she is and I personally don't think she would see me and feel threatened (but maybe that's my own self esteem talking).

\-Some have asked why I care about this. Several reasons, mostly that it will make social interactions more awkward and I will have to be much more aware of if I'm being too nice or friendly. I worry that as soon as the rumor mill starts of ""she must've done something for his wife to be jealous"" other people will look at me differently and judge my platonic interactions with my male coworkers accordingly. This could lead to a toxic work situation.

\-

**TLDR:** Coworkers wife believes I am being inappropriate with her husband, my coworker. How do I diffuse the situation and keep my work environment from being stressful and full of drama?",True
114,114,"FINAL UPDATE: we’ve called her successfully and her documents with her purse were found at the airport. She is coming home soon and thanks a lot guys for help and support throughout this whole thing. You guys are amazing.
A few details: she did a purchase in duty free at 2:15 am on a large sum (13600 rubles) and ate in an airport restaurant at 2:35. She was supposed to board a flight to Moscow at 4 am but she didn’t (according to Russian police) We can’t contact her and the messages can’t reach her. Russian police told me I should call the local police department but they’re not responding. I also don’t speak English that well. What should I do? I’m panicking right now. UPDATE: we’ve contacted the embassy, they told us that she didn’t leave the transfer zone and is still in the airport UPDATE 2: according to my father, a policeman is supposed to be looking for her in the transfer zone and that the embassy has contacted the Turkish ministry of interior about the missing person, the airport staff and the airline staff about the incident (Aeroflot) UPDATE 3: we got the information that she changed the ticket somewhere between 3 and 5 pm, but didn’t board a second time. UPDATE 4: my grandpa is on his to Istanbul and should arrive in the transfer zone at 2 or 3 am to investigate himself because the embassy didn’t do anything for an entire day UPDATE 5: SHE IS ALIVE! SHE MADE A PURCHASE IN A RESTAURANT SIMIT SARAYI AT 1:22 am at THE AIRPORT using her credit card! I AM SO HAPPY! UPDATE 6: grandpa had arrived at the airport at 3 am, but it’s 10 am and we’ve lost contact with him as well. Things aren’t looking bright. IMPORTANT UPDATE 7: SHE HAS BEEN FOUND! My father had called her successfully and it turns out her documents had been stolen and she is still in Istanbul airport. He couldn’t provide more details because he is waiting for the police to call him back.","My partner (25m) is my (26f) rock and I’m his. Literally he tells me that all the time including yesterday. We’ve been together for five years and have a truly wonderful relationship. Always talking, laughing, comfortable with one another. Able to communicate even when we disagree. After I survived abuse as a child and struggled with unhealthy romantic relationships in the past, the fact that we love each other in a respectful, secure and profoundly healthy way is truly my biggest blessing and I wake up every day so happy and grateful for him. He is an incredible man with so much drive, intelligence, kindness, and gifts to give the world.

About a year and a half ago it came up for the first time that we saw ourselves getting married one day. It was such a beautiful moment and it rocked my world to have been vulnerable, said those words, and have him say them too. Since then it’s been something incredibly happy that I get to hold in my heart and look forward to. The subject has come up sporadically since then but I haven’t wanted to push it too far since we are young and it is very much an “eventually” thing. Both of our parents are divorced and his come from money. He got a lot of strong advice growing up not to marry young and to protect his assets, to see it from a more financial view than I ever have thought of it. 

Nevertheless the thought makes me happy and we often daydream about the future we’ll build together: the little house in New Hampshire we hope to buy and the dogs and chickens we’ll have. These are conversations he participates in and brings up on his own all the time. I want to be able to talk casually about the marriage aspect, too - go to bed with a sleepy “can’t wait to marry you” or “love of my life” - but for some reason recently whenever the subject has come up he’s clammed up and made it feel really serious. This culminated maybe two months ago with a really weird conversation in which I sensed he might not have processed what marriage really means to him in the way that I had, and that he wasn’t ready to be talking about this in the way that I was or as much as he had let on. I told him I don’t want to put a gun to his head, this is just something that makes me happy to think about and talk about, and I tell him everything. I said I love him for him; I’d wait as long as he needs; but that I firmly didn’t want to bring up the subject again until he was comfortable discussing it. I wanted to relieve the pressure on him, and I haven’t mentioned it since. 

Well, yesterday we spent a really lovely day getting lunch and hiking with my family. They live far away so we don’t see them very often. My stepsister and her fiancé were there as well, and of course there was a little bit of light conversation about their upcoming wedding. My bf was his usual friendly, easygoing self. I noticed he seemed quiet on the way home and later that evening so I asked if he was worried about work but he just said he was tired from a long day traveling. I made him a drink, kissed him on the forehead like I always do and promised we could do whatever he wanted to relax that night. Just did what I normally do when I can tell he’s stressed, try to show empathy and take care of him. 

But then as I’m making dinner he comes over to me and drops this bomb. He came over to me crying and said spending time with an engaged couple and even barely talking about their wedding had sent him into a panic and he didn’t know if he could ever see himself getting married. I was completely blindsided. I tried to parse what he was saying but it was like my brain was stuck. Evidently he had been locking himself in his office at work all week crying about this. I kept asking him why he would say he wanted to marry me if he didn’t. He said he was lying, basically. That he wanted to give me what he knew I wanted to make me happy. I could only just stare at him open mouthed. I kept trying to pinpoint if he was saying to me, “I don’t think I’ll be ready to get married for a long time” or “I don’t think I’ll ever be ready to get married” and I really don’t think he knows himself. I don’t think he has processed marriage at all and this is the first time it’s hitting him. He kept saying stuff about not knowing where his career will lead or if he’ll have money (he has a great job, an outstanding network, and is definitely not poor. Neither of us are) and I was just like. We’re a partnership. You wanted to be with me yesterday, you want to be with me today, do you want to be with me tomorrow? Yes, he said. I said well that’s all what matters, we have a life we love and we’ll take on the future together one day. 

I’m devastated. He left for his stepmother’s house and I don’t know when he’ll be home. I can not take another sleeping pill or my heart will stop but I can’t sleep a wink. I literally spiked a 100 degree fever and spent all night sweating and freezing. I had no idea it was possible to be in so much pain it makes you physically sick. This person is the bedrock of my life. We have ALWAYS had rock solid confidence that we can trust each other, be vulnerable around each other, and be our full authentic selves without inhibition or fear of judgment We share everything together and we are best friends. He even said that over and over as he sobbed and told me he loved me and that he didn’t want to get married. Hours ago I had the most beautiful and solid relationship in the world. Now I don’t know if we’re going to break up. I’m reeling. I feel like I’ve been stabbed in the back by my safe space. The earth fell out from under me and I don’t even know what to think any more. 

What do I even do or say to save this? Was I too strong in voicing my desire to get married that I scared him off? Has anyone else gone through something similar?

TLDR; my boyfriend of five years held in all his fears about marriage and commitment and they all exploded out at once, and now our amazing and healthy relationship could completely sink out of nowhere.",True

This is my first post so sorry of it’s formatted weird.


I’m (14m) and my real mom died 5 years ago. My dad (44m) married Kendra (46f) 3 years ago. Kendra has always treated me with so much love and kindness. At her and my dad’s wedding she recited vows to me that she wasn’t trying to replace my mom but to try and be a great stepmom to me.


Kendra has always called me her son and I like it. It makes me feel like I’m loved by another mom. Kendra has also been someone that I turn to when I need help. Like when I have had homework she helps me with it or when I was being bullied in school for my stutter she was the one that I turned to and she talked to my school about it.


I love Kendra a lot and I want to start calling her mom but I don’t know how. I also kind of feel though like it would be a betrayal and disrespectful to my real mom to call Kendra mom. Does anyone have advice on what to do because I’m torn right now.

TLDR: Focusing less on myself and opening up to compromise has paid off big time!

The vast majority of commenters on my original post said that either there was a specific reason he didn't want to get married, or that we were fundamentally incompatible because we had different views on marriage. Fortunately, it's the former! When I brought it up again, I decided to approach the subject differently- rather than focusing on what I wanted, I focused on what he wanted from the future, and how that might fit with my vision of my own life. 

The first thing I learned from this new approach is that my dear, introverted partner loathes the idea of turning our relationship into a giant showy party, and being vulnerable/romantic in front of our messy, chaotic families. Love should be private, and he hates weddings.  We talked this over and I made it clear that 1) I do not care what our wedding looks like  2) I am happy to wait until he is comfortable with the idea and 3) While I don't care about weddings, marriage is an important part of a lifetime partnership for me. He told me he would think about that, and that it made him feel better to know that I didn't mind forgoing the stuff he sees as ""superficial."" 

Last night, we were discussing our long-term career goals, and he told me that he now does see marriage as part of those plans, because he wants to plan our lives in tandem, and agrees that the benefits and the commitment of marriage are a part of the vision he has of our partnership. He realized that my willingness to forgo the kind of wedding I originally wanted to preserve his comfort made him want to compromise too and he's ready to start incorporating traditional romantic gestures into our lives- including ""the whole song and dance"" of proposals (this is big for him because he is NOT a romantic). We talked it over and agreed that marriage within a year of my finishing law school was the right timeline. This gives him plenty of time to work on his issues with weddings and think about what ours should look like. Knowing that we have the same vision for our lives and a solid timeline in mind completely assuages my worries. 

And lord the way I blushed when he said he planned to have a ring on my finger before I graduate... I must have glowed.",True
117,117,"Last night my girlfriends asked me to send ykw and because I was tired and couldn’t think straight I accidentally sent it to my family group chat what should I do now

Update : MY family still haven’t sent any new messages and my mum messaged me privately angrily saying “ remove that right now!! “ that’s all I have currently

2nd update : I have messaged the group chat “ I am so sorry, this was meant to be sent to my doctor for medical reasons, I have deleted the pic. “

3rd update : my brother tried to understand and he definitely knows I wasn’t sending that to my doctor he messaged me saying “ happens to the best of us it’s fine just apologise and move on “ 

4th update : no one has replied and it’s making me more and more worse 

5th and most likely last update : my step sister and aunt left the group chat 

Final update : I have apologised a second time and now my step sister and aunt got added back, they had arranged a family event where we go out for food and my other aunt was the one who arranged it so she said “ I have booked the restaurant “ I don’t think she saw the picture and as far as I know only 6 people have saw it and hopefully no one talks about it… this is the final update unless somettting else happens
 
Actual final update : Dinner was really awkward I kept pretending I needed to go to the restroom when in reality I was just tryna get a break from how uncomfortable I felt. This is the final update

I’m 19 male 12 people in that chat with immediate family and a few cousins","I (32M) have been married with Rose (40F) for 4 years and we dated for 2 before that. Rose has a daughter, Lola, she is 9. Her father, John (42M) is quite present in her life and is a good dad ( he lives 2 hours away due to his work but he spend a lot of time with her during the weekends, holidays, they video chat a lot, he comes to all her school plays, sport events etc etc).

When I started dating Rose, I didn't know what my relationship with Lola would be. I have had both a step-mother and a step-father so I know these kind of relationships can get bad easily, so I tried to do my best. I played with her, listened to her whenever she wanted to talk, helped if she needed help and I didn't set any rule but made sure she followed Rose's rules. In the past 6 years, we bonded.

Something happened yesterday: she aced a math test (the only full score in the whole class. Am I allowed to be proud of her? I will be anyway). I wanted to reward her and she wanted an ice cream, so we went to the ice cream shop. When I gave her the ice cream, she said ""thank you, dad"" and rushed back in the car. I was stunned. I didn't know how to react. She never called me dad, she normally call me by my name or nickname. She seemed to not realize she had done it so I acted normally and brought her back home and we celebrated with Rose.

I don't know what I should do if she calls me dad again. I'm happy about it, don't misunderstand me. I love her as if she was my own daughter but she already has a father and they love each other a lot and I think he wouldn't like hearing her call someone else ""dad"". Should I tell her something?

118,118,"My father opened my door at 3am tonight while I was masturbating but was stopped by my dog (who’s normally in a crate but luckily wasn’t tonight) being alerted I’m not sure what his intentions where but I don’t think they were good I can’t tell my mom and I’m to scarred to sleep what do I do?

I’ll add for more context but (F17) I’ve always been creeped out by him and have caught him looking at my boobs and ass on multiple occasions along with in order for me to not have heard him he had to be very careful since our hallway is loud and I was using a v so I he must have heard what was happening before he decided to open the door my mother has also always been the one to check up on me and she hasn’t done that in years

Edit: I’ll also put that my mom knows I sleep shirtless because it gets really hot in my room and she told me that she warned my father about it and to not go in without knocking after she went to wake me up one morning and my chest was exposed so he knows that I sleep without any top on

Update: Sorry it’s been a while I’ve had a lot of stuff happening with school and everything. I just wanted to give an update incase anyone cares. So for I think two months I’ve been sleeping in the guest room downstairs so that it was easier to put my doggies out in the morning and obviously I didn’t say this but to stay farther away from my father. Because of this and me avoiding him likely nothing else has happened however I am moving back to my old room since my grandpa needs the room I’ll give an update if anything happens right away, and in a few months I’ll let y’all know if nothing has happened. 

And I’ll add yes I understand many of y’all want me to tell my mom I can’t. She never believes me on anything I’ve never understood it but no matter what she believes my father and my siblings over me any day and I’m worried I’ll get in trouble if I tell her, so as much as y’all want me to I can’t talk to her about this.","I (38F) am having trouble being there for my sister (32F), and I’m not sure how to tell her why.

I’m about two years out of a 17-year marriage that ended extremely badly. We had issues throughout the relationship (as well as a lot of fun), but the last couple years he was intensely controlling, abusive, and violent, and since he left I’ve done a lot of work to recover and get myself in a healthy headspace.

My sister went through a rough patch around the same time my divorce started, and I learned way too much about her husband (37M) during that period to ever trust him again. They’ve been together for years and while he’s never been my family’s favorite (insufferable know-it-all, dominates every conversation, generally pretty annoying), we all just dealt with it because she loved him and we’re adults. 

But since their rough patch, I haven’t been able to be around him. During that time he served her with divorce papers and told her he was going to take their <1 year old baby away and never let my sister see her again. He convinced my sister she would lose in court anyway, to the point that her plan was to give up, sign all the paperwork he gave her, and leave their baby while she moved out of state with our other sister. This all sounds bad, but my sister is extremely naive and also has the worst anxiety I’ve ever seen. She was convinced she’d lose their baby no matter what, and she was so broken down she didn’t have it in her to fight. Anyway, she told me this plan and I successfully talked her out of it, got her a great lawyer, and she was on her way towards accepting their divorce and rebuilding her life when he suddenly changed his mind and they reconciled and have been acting like everything is fine ever since.

During her eventually-abandoned divorce, my sister was terrified of being homeless and not having anywhere to go. I was starting over too, so our plan was that I’d buy a triplex and she and her baby could live in one of the units, me in one, and our little brother (22M) in the third one. I went ahead with that plan and have just been renting out my sister’s unit and let her know it’s there if she needs it.

I cannot be around my sister’s husband at all. I’ve seen behind the scenes. I know he’s abusing her emotionally, financially, and I strongly suspect physically too, although she’d never admit it. 

I am aware that the right thing to do here is support her decision, and grin and bear his company, but I can’t do it. I get that it’s immature of me, but the situation is too much like my own marriage, and I won’t be within 100 feet of it. I especially don’t want him in my new home, which for two years has been a happy, heathy, peaceful safe zone.

My sister basically won’t leave the house without this man (because of her anxiety and also his control issues), and they are literally ALWAYS together. She posted on Instagram a few weeks ago about being sad and confused about why her family never spends time with her anymore. I’d like to gently explain the situation to her, but I’m not sure how to tactfully say “it’s not you, it’s your awful abusive husband we can’t stand.” Looking for advice on how to softly tell her I’m here if she needs me but that I’m unwilling to be around her husband.

TL;DR How do I tell my sister that I love her and want a relationship but that I can’t be around her abusive husband because he triggers my own relationship baggage?",True
119,119,My dad is super old fashioned. He basically doesn't let me do anything unless it's extremely necessary. He's always been that way but he got worse after my mom left. He only lets me wear bras to school but I'm not allowed to wear them at home. According to him bras slow down growth. Anytime I try to explain that's it's complete nonsense he just gets angry and I get grounded. Idk what to do.,"Please please please know that my boyfriend is a very good person and that I love him very much, but I feel like I’m at my breaking point because I can’t compete with his life anymore, and I really need some advice.

Full disclosure: My boyfriend and I moved very quickly in our relationship. It was the type of instant and intense “love at first sight” where it felt almost uncanny how similar we were..

I felt such an instant and intimate connection to him that I didn’t think twice about quitting my career and moving to a different state with him quite quickly, and despite that risk it actually worked out really well until recently.

I began noticing last winter that I felt more like an accessory to my boyfriend’s life, and that he seemed like he was still living a bachelor life. The first major fracture of our relationship was when he merged businesses with a friend on a whim and moved cities to go work with him, meaning that instead of being home every night like he normally was, he was gone 3-4 days a week. I won’t lie to say that I was furious. I wanted to be happy and supportive of his business decisions, but he made literally no effort in discussing this to me beforehand.

The next fracture came from something that I had signed up for willingly, but it has become a problem as I’ve grown to start feeling resentful. My boyfriend owns a business with his family, who he is extremely close with. All of his time when he is back home gets put into the family business. In the beginning, I was really enthusiastic about this business, and I would volunteer time to get to know his parents and the community better, but now I want nothing to do with it because it feels like there’s way too much expectation for me to engage with it.

His parents were very welcoming to me, and they entrusted me to do a lot with the business which I was happy to do, but now that my boyfriend is gone most of the week, it seems like even more of my time is being spent maintaining aspects of my boyfriend’s life instead of me trying to carve a place for myself in my new home.

Then there’s the problem that when my boyfriend is at home, all of his time goes into this family business, and so I feel even further away from the main cast of his life. Weirdly enough, now I’m much closer with my boyfriend’s sister than I am with my boyfriend, as her and I hang out and talk more than I do with him, which would be a lovely and beautiful thing if I also had that with my boyfriend, but instead I feel that if it weren’t for his sister supporting me, I’d be abandoned.

Finally the last major fracture is the dog we have together. Our dog is a highly energetic breed and requires a lot of attention and time. This was no issue in the beginning and the dog always felt naturally like “my dog” but it was the expectation that both my boyfriend and I would take care of her. Yet now our dog seems to have been back-seated, just like me. 

For example, if I’ve asked my boyfriend to watch the dog because I’m vacuuming or cooking or even want time by myself, he will take her for 20 minutes and then eventually lose concentration until she comes to find me in hopes I will play with her.

I actually had a bit of a freakout about this when my boyfriend and I were invited to a big family celebration a few weeks ago. I told my boyfriend that I didn’t want to bring the dog because she is way too excitable around people and I just wanted to focus on meeting some of his extended family and making a good first impression with them, since he is so close to his family. My boyfriend begged me to take the dog with us because he missed her.

I reluctantly agreed, only because he swore that “he would take care of her and that there would be a lot of other dogs there.” My boyfriend also promised he wouldn’t drink because my car was in the shop and we had to drive his vehicle, which is standard and something I can’t drive because I never learned how to drive stick. 

We show up, and embarrassingly we are the only people there with a dog. My boyfriend abandoned me almost immediately to spend time and to catch up with his family members, who I couldn’t meet because my dog is extremely excitable around people, so I have to stay in the outer circle of the fun with her so that she can remain relaxed. 

Worse yet is the hostess, and a few people who helped her set up, swung by and commented that “they were hoping that this would be a no-dog party” and that “they would make sure I know next time when dogs aren’t allowed” and it felt so awfully embarrassing to me that I nearly cried. 

There I was, all alone at a party where I don’t know anyone, with an animal tied to my hand which clearly was extremely unwelcomed, and to make it worse now looks like it was my idea because I’m hanging on the sidelines avoiding people instead of socializing.

Even more devastating was when I did finally find my boyfriend, he was already halfway to being drunk, to which he laughed and said to me “we can just take a taxi!” Through gritted teeth, I then told him “We can’t. We have the dog!” 

The only thing that saved us was my boyfriend’s extremely nice uncle, who I think was a mind reader or something. He came up to me, as I was nearly in tears and asked me how I was getting home. I explained the situation and he gave me the keys to his car so that me, the dog and my boyfriend could get home that night.

That last situation very much felt like the final straw and we had a massive blow out about it. It wasn’t the first conversation we had about this type of thing, and yet over and over and over again my boyfriend keeps telling me “I’m #1” and “tell me what to do so I can change.”

But I don’t want to be that person who is the dictator in someone else’s life and keep putting up ultimatums. I don’t want to have to feel like I’m competing with someone else’s life or like I have to explain to them how to treat me like a girlfriend instead of just some afterthought.

We had a conversation again last night where I told him I was unhappy, and I asked him if he understood why. I was hoping, praying, that from all of our conversations he would know. And yet all he could say was that he could tell I was unhappy in our relationship but he didn’t understand what for.

I went numb. It feels like if I walked out tomorrow nothing in his life would change, except maybe he wouldn’t have to have conversations anymore about how impossible it is to make me happy.

I just feel like an accessory and it hurts so bad.

Yet I still don’t know if this relationship is worth giving up because my boyfriend does love me and we align so well in our life goals. 

I finally broke down and spilled the beans to his sister, who calmly said “My brother is a good man and I can see he loves you very much, but he’s always been immature in his relationships and his idea of compromising is him saying he’s willing to compromise.” She then told me that she would support me no matter what I do.

Does anyone know what I can do?

Has anyone ever felt like an accessory in their relationship?

**TL;DR:** My boyfriend continues to live his life as a bachelor despite me living with him and us building a life together. He makes big decisions by himself without talking to me about them, and I feel like I have to run his life when he’s gone. His total freedom in his life makes me feel chained to maintaining our relationship instead of us being equal life partners. Is it over?",True
120,120,"Planned Parenthood Broke HIPAA laws and called my mom
For context, I am 19 years old and in college. I found out I was pregnant a week and a half ago and thought hard but ultimately decided i cannot give a baby what it needs right now. I scheduled my appointment for planned parenthood and decided that i would never tell my parents. right after i had left my mom knew i was pregnant, she said one of her old friends she used to work with works there and called her to let her know that i was getting an abortion, she confirmed my full name and my cell phone number and stated that she knew she was breaking HIPAA but she had to tell my mom. My whole life has been turned upside down since this lady told my mom, my parents help me out financially a lot which i am so grateful for while i am in school and i have been cut off completely as well as called a slut or a whore every 5 minutes by my mom. my father won’t even speak to me. What should i do?




Update: Thank you guys for all the kind comments I have received. I haven’t done anything yet as this is so recent. I think I am going to get a consultation with a lawyer and talk about my options. I am just scared to burn bridges with my parents for good and this lady is my moms friend so I think she might disown me, I think I can figure out my financial situations because I do have a job and just got offered a promotion so paying my rent shouldn’t be an issue and I can get financial aid i hope. If I don’t end up taking this to court I will still alert planned parenthood of her breaking hipaa laws and hopefully she won’t be able to do this to other girls. Honestly, I am just scared beyond belief and am heartbroken to say the least, I love my family even though sometimes they don’t treat me well. I will update again when I fully decide but I am taking each comment into consideration. Also i don’t think PP is a bad organization at all I think there is just a bad person working there which is another reason I’m hesitant because I wouldn’t want to harm some girls only option for safe termination.","Example: She was cooking mac and cheese for the kids and spilled some of it. She texts me asking if we need to make more or if we have enough. She's in the kitchen with the mac and cheese - I figure she should be able to figure out if we have enough. 

Another one: Car radio wouldn't shut off when the car was off. She calls me, but is able to figure out the solution before she can even explain what's happening. I can't imagine calling my wife about a problem like that before trying to fix it myself.

The thing is, she used to be more independent, but now relies on me for every little thing. I explain it to her, but can't seem to get her to understand without getting even more frustrated. Is this just my life now?

---
**tl;dr**: wife needs help with every little problem. I think she should try herself before looking for help.

edit: Thank you all for your help. I had a very positive conversation with my wife. As most of you said, it was anxiety based on stress. She's going to work on it, and I'm going to try to be less critical when she asks for help or does things halfway. Sorry I couldn't respond to everyone.",True
121,121,"I usually stay at my boyfriends but i was going to meet my friend so i asked my boyfriend to drive me home. When i realised i forgot my phone in his room i told him he could wait in the car while i get it. I go into his room looking everywhere with no sign of it. That's when i decide to look under his bed. His nephew (17m) was looking with me when i checked under the bed. That's when it happened, there was a yellow ziplock bag that looked to be full of some unknown liquid, i poke it and then ask his nephew if he knows what it is. He picks it up and that's the moment we realised this was most likely piss. His nephew is absolutely disgusted and so was i tbh, but i still wanted to give my boyfriend the benefit of the doubt. Because the idea of me sleeping above a bag of piss wasn't something i found exciting.    
When i enter the car with no phone and a confused and grossed out expression my boyfriend ofc asks me what was on my mind. I tell him i found his little contraption and asked him if there was piss in the bag. He gets defensive immidatly. He tells me most men have a piss bag and that i'm being insanely dramatic for telling him to maybe not do that. I want to express how insanely disgusting this is but he's absolutely convinced that i'm dramatic and he's perfecly normal. How do i handle this?","My brother (let's call him Danny) recently signed up with an adult modeling agency and my family, especially my parents (60s M&F) are taking it terribly.

He also tried to break into the industry a few years back with his girlfriend but was unable to. My parents did not know this but he did tell me. At the time I tried to persuade him not to but it seemed like he was determined on that career choice. And he seemed like he was using the right channels and being safe so I  thought I would lay off him. 

But some other things got in the way and he didn't make it. I watched Danny spiral completely out of control, he was a really good looking guy but he put on a lot of weight and overall just seemed miserable. But he did finish college and get a job.

About a year back he started working out religiously again and seemd to be in a better mood, he told me he was going to try and get back into the adult entertainment industry. And this time he did.

Danny first told me and my husband (36 M), my husband was in disbelief but was curious as well. He then told our parents and all hell broke lose... my mom especially took the news terribly and I am honestly scared for her. She is also super disappointed with me for not telling Danny what to do.

My parents told the extended family as well and everyone is super disappointed with Danny, even though he seems genuinely happy after ages. My cousin (28 F) who Danny considers to be his second sister won't talk to him and is super angry with me for supporting him.

My parents want me to convince Danny to move back in with them (Danny lives in one of the largest cities in the US for adult entertainment, and my parents and I live about 3 hours away).

I am just looking out for my brother and I want him to do well and be happy, and if this is how he does it then so be it.

I just don't know how to convince my family of this as well.

TL;DR My Family is super angry with my brother for entering the adult entertainment industry and with me for supporting him.",True
122,122,"my boyfriend (26m) and i (20f) have been dating for a little over 4 years. about a year and 1/2 ago we moved into an apartment together. we live next door to a father (mid40s m) and his daughter (14f), who my bf has been tutoring 2 or 3 times a week for the last 8ish months. she was struggling with school and her father works long hours so my bf volunteered to help her with her studies. i didn’t see anything odd about that at the time because my bf is planning on becoming a teacher. 

i don’t know how, but a few days ago it was discovered that the daughter has been being sexually abused, and my bf has been interviewed by the police a couple of times in regards to this. he assured me that they have to interview any male in contact with her and that it doesn’t mean anything, but i’m extremely worried. i have no idea what to do in this situation and what to believe, and desperately need some advice. what should i do? how do i handle this??? any advice is appreciated","My sister (15F) and I (25F) have always been extremely close. We've always gotten along so well, and although we have a big age difference, I have always thought of her as my best friend. I deeply love her, and we have never fought before. Whenever she has needed me, I have made sure to be there, because I never had a sibling growing up, so I always wanted to be the type of sister I would have liked myself. A few months ago, I noticed she was having a hard time, and I honestly thought she was being bullied at school. After having a deep heart-to-heart conversation, she told me she was gay. Our family is Mexican, and she told me she was nervous about having to tell my dad. I kept her secret and supported her until she was ready to tell my parents, even telling her some of my identity problems that I also had myself when I was her age. Once she was ready, we all had a family talk, and she came out. My parents were really supportive, and my dad had no problems, he said that it didn't matter and that she was not the only gay person in the family (a Mexican dad joke, I guess). After this talk, I thought we we were closer than ever before. She said she wanted to change her style, so we went shopping and I bought her a whole new wardrobe, because I wanted her to feel confident. Also, I don't have any kids, so I always spend my extra income on her, because I love going out with her.

&#x200B;

About 2 months ago, my sister went to Mexico to visit our grandparents for vacation. I have a work phone that is paid for by my company, and my personal phone. My parents don't believe in buying their kids phones, until they can pay for it themselves. I honestly didn't have a cell phone until I was 18 years old. Since I started working I gave my personal cell phone to my sister so that she could use it instead. However since she was leaving to Mexico, I asked for it back since my phone plan doesn't include roaming.

&#x200B;

The day she left for Mexico, and gave me back the phone, something felt off. Have you guys ever felt that pit feeling in your stomach you can't explain, but you just know something is not right. Almost like a 6th sense. I've only ever experienced this once before, and I felt like this before I found out my ex-boyfriend had cheated on me. Like my body knew, before I found out. Well the same thing happened when she left. I know I shouldn't have done this but I went on my phone to check her messages, and then I saw just how much shit she was talking about me to her friends. She had told her friends very personal things I had opened up to her about when she was previously coming out. I could not believe what I was reading. She said that the only good thing I was good at was buying her stuff, and taking her out. That I couldn't get a boyfriend even if I tried, and other personal things I don't feel like bringing up. I was so shocked, because this came out of nowhere. I felt blind-sided. I called my mom and broke out crying on the phone telling her what I had read. I was so hurt. To the point that I would honestly break out crying throughout the firsts few days whenever I would think about it.

&#x200B;

When I visited my mom she told me that my sister was just a child and that I shouldn't take what she said about me personally. That she's immature and stupid, and probably trying to 'fit in' with her friends. But I just don't understand why this is happening? Has she been secretly hating me this whole time? Has our whole relationship been fake? I was breaking down crying in front of my mom, but I don't think she understood just how much this had affected me. She was honestly almost getting mad at me, because she kept reiterating my sister was only 15 and not an adult.

&#x200B;

The whole time she was in Mexico, I didn't contact her once. My grandma did end up calling me asking why I hadn't called them, and I did end up telling her what happened, mostly because I felt as though my mom had made me feel like I was the crazy one. My grandma just said she understood and left it at that. So me and my sister didn't talk the whole 2 months she was there. I once called my grandparents' house to check up on them, and my sister answered the phone, and I just hanged up.

&#x200B;

Needless to say, she is back home, and my family is acting as though I am the crazy one for not talking to her. They say I am the adult in the situation and that she is a child. That I should know better, and that I shouldn't 'crucify' her for her mistake. My dad almost broke out in the tears the other day when he asked me why I wasn't talking to her. He said he would understand if I was this angry if my sister was an adult, but she's not, so I shouldn't be treating her this way. It was so embarrassing having to tell my dad the types of things my sister said about me in those texts, only for him to say that my sister doesn't know any better. I tried confronting her in front of my parents, but she didn't say anything and only let out tears, she didn't even apologize, she literally didn't say anything the whole time. I was crying like crazy, and to be honest I was screaming because I was angry she wasn't saying anything. I though after everything we've been through I at least deserved an explanation. But then I felt as though my family was turning on me, because they kept saying the same narrative of her being a dumb kid whose brain hasn't fully developed. I left because they honestly made me feel as though I was in the wrong, and that I wasn't allowed to express my feelings.

&#x200B;

I obviously haven't talked to her, and I really don't plan to. But my parents really did get under my skin, because sometimes I feel as though I really am in the wrong. Maybe I just forgot what it was like to be that age. I don't know, my grandma thinks I should look into counseling, because she sees how much this has affected me and how I haven't been able to 'let it go.'

&#x200B;

I understand that she's young, but this really hurt me. It came out of nowhere. I just really need some advice, am I really overreacting?

&#x200B;

TLDR: Found out my little sister was talking mad shit about me behind my back, even though I thought we had the best relationship. Family thinks I should move on and forgive her because I am an adult, but I'm really hurt and can't seem to let it go. I don't know what do, am I in the wrong to feel this way?",True
123,123,"I walked in on my cousin and my brother making out. I‘m 14, my brother is 15 and my cousin is 16 (all male). We’ve been close since childhood, always running around together and playing video games, yk, what kids do. In the past year I’ve noticed them getting closer, but ofc just thought they were bonding so I didn’t really suspect anything. Two days ago we all met at our yearly family gathering, it was really fun and I got to see a lot of people that I missed. My brother, my cousin and I decided that we want to stay at my grandparents house for a few more days so that we can hang out because we don’t see each other that much anymore. Yesterday, i went out for a little to get food from the store across the street. It took me a bit longer because we eat a LOT of snacks and it was like shopping for a family of 5. When I came back after around an hour or so I noticed it was quiet, which is very weird for us since we’re all very loud. I walked upstairs to the bedroom we shared to figure out why and when I opened the door my brother was on top on my cousin and they were making out. Like heavily making out. My brother wasn’t wearing a shirt and his hands were all over my cousin. I just kinda froze and they jumped apart. My cousin started crying and my brother instantly comforted him, he himself also tearing up. I awkwardly stood before walking out. I just kinda sat on the porch for a bit, processing what just happened. My brother came out of the house and we awkwardly sat in silence for a while before he spoke up. He said “I know it’s weird but me and [name] really love each other. I’m sorry you found out this way.” And walked off. It’s been really awkward and I don’t know what to do. I don’t really know how I feel about it either. I, for one, didn’t know either of them were gay. I’m in no way homophobic, my girlfriend is bi and I have a lot of gay friends who I support fully, although I am straight (I think). But secondly, we are literally related. Our dads are brothers, and I see both of them as brothers. I mean they’re happy, but yet again oh my god. Im definitely not going to tell anyone in our family, I don’t want to ruin their relationship even if it’s a bit weird. But I also don’t know, I feel like our relationship isn’t going to be the same, and I kinda don’t want to be that close to them anymore, which makes me feel bad. What should I do?

EDIT: I talked to them earlier and we had a long discussion about it. I told them that I do support them being gay, but I’m not sure about their relationship. They said they understood and I asked for a bit of space. I also promised them that I won’t tell an adult, or anyone I know irl for that matter. I asked how long they had been a thing and they said 11 months, so it’s been going on a for a bit. I told them I was happy that they found love but am slightly weirded out. Im currently not talking to either for them for at least a few days and just taking my time to think, Ty for the advice!

Also, for all the people assuming I’m in the US and stuff, I’m German, live there and all this is happening in Germany. Please stop making Alabama jokes, it’s annoying :)","My boyfriend (M37) and I (F29) have been in a relationship for seven months and I really, really like him. He is an amazing person whom I would love to build a future with. There is just one problem: we are (maybe) no longer on the same page regarding having children or not. I have been very honest from the start: I can't have biological children and I am not interested in adoption. I am going to live a child-free life (with lots of nieces and nephews) and I am okay with that. When we met, it wasn't an issue for my now-boyfriend. As he said back then: ""If I really wanted children I am sure I would have some by now"". However, a few months ago this attitude changed. Suddenly he went from that to ""I'm not sure what I want and I was actually hoping you would change your mind over time, just in case"". This made me very upset since I've never indicated I would some day reconsider my decision to not have children. At that time we had already started planning a vacation in August in another country (we'll be hiking and have both spend a lot of money on new gear and are both super excited about going) so we decided to not make any decisions regarding our relationship until after the vacation. He promised that when we are back he will have made up his mind on whether or not a life without children is a dealbreaker after all. 
I just find really difficult for me to wait for his decision even though it was a mutual agreement that we wouldn't discuss it further until after the vacation. At the same time I don't want to push him as I think it's understandable that he needs time to really think about it. He has told me that he can't imagine being with anybody else (and neither can I) which makes it even more heartbreaking. 
Would it be fair to ""demand"" an answer before the vacation, or should I give him some time and wait as we agreed? 

(Sorry for my broken English, I'm not a native speaker) 

Edit: some of you are wondering why I can’t have biologial children. I am on medication that cause harm to the fetus and as a result of that I decided to get a sterilization five years ago. It gave me a sense of control over my body and I’ve never regretted that decision.

124,124,My fiance (21F) was super stoned and drunk and slept downstairs and my brother (18M) and he fucked her. I don't believe that she was able to consent because of her imparedness. Am I right is it his fault? My family says it wasn't his fault and i should forgive him.,"
I [26F] have been seeing Adam[36M] for approx 6 weeks. We matched on a dating app but I also knew him from the occasional hallway greeting at work. We've been sleeping together since the first date and have hung out at least once a week. 


Several days ago I found out Ashley [25F], a friend of mine, has also been seeing him. They started talking 4 wks ago (2 wks into me seeing him). They went on a date 2 wks ago (4 wks into me seeing him). They had plans last week but Ashley had to cancel. Adam has been very straightforward about wanting to sleep with her during their texts/talks. His date plans with her mirror my experiences.


Adam and I did not have a conversation about exclusivity. Technically he did nothing wrong by hooking up with her but the fact that he used the same formula on her as me bothers me. I don't like that I was the backup option for the day she couldn't make it. Especially since by that point we'd been on dates without hooking up and have had conversations that I wouldn't do with a random fling.


Ashley and I hung out in a couple days ago in a group setting when the whole Adam ordeal came to light. I texted him as soon as I learned about it. The next day Ashley and I met and had a healthy one on one conversation about the situation where she disclosed everything, despite his ask not to. We decided it would be best for both of us to step back - her, because I was developing feelings for him, and me, because I was uncomfortable about things. 


After he'd gotten texts from each of us he confessed to Ashley and me that he'd liked me for a while and wanted to pursue more but was waiting until I was ready and would delete dating apps if I asked. He said he was planning to have a discussion about exclusivity the next time we met. 


I'm not sure how I should approach this. His interactions with Ashley led me to believe he was only interested in something casual. If it weren't a close friend I might be more objective about the situation but with how things have unfolded I'm not sure. Is initiating & pursuing a sexual relationship with another person while in the beginning stages of non-exclusively dating someone you like a red flag? Should I try dating him or commit to backing off? 

*EDIT 1 : yes it was safe sex. I get tested regularly as does he. I confirmed this before doing anything. I wasn't expecting exclusivity and also dated around for the first few weeks we saw each other (all were casual and didn't end with anything intimate). I would be less bothered by things if I didn't know the finer details, if it wasn't my friend, or if he responded to our texts in a way that reflected his actions of dating casually.*

*EDIT 2 : I've gotten a lot of comments criticizing him for not being exclusive. That's not a deal breaker for me, but what bothers me most is his response to being ""caught"". Especially since he's 10 years older than me. Thanks for helping me clarify my feelings, I really appreciate it. Definetly has saved me from future pain.*

*I'm going to bow out gracefully and go out dancing with Ashley to celebrate our friendship. We deserve it for dealing with all this bullshit, lol.*

**TLDR; [36M] and I[26F] have been seeing each other for 6 weeks and had not discussed exclusivity but it was getting serious. For the last 4 wks he's been pursuing FWB with a close friend of mine [25F]. Should I walk away?**",True

Hi, I (20F) am currently in my 4th semester of college.  The fact that I am able to go to college is largely thanks to my brother Mike (27M).  This resulted in us both being estranged from family, and the reason for this post is that I need to help him with his resulting depression and isolation.

Some backstory:  We come from a patriarchal, conservative Christian background, altho we didnt really practice.  But everything was always in the “obey your parents” vibe.  My parents (both 43) are the oldest siblings in their families.   My fathers family (parents, 2 brothers, 1 sister) all live within 20 minutes of my parents home.  All aunts/uncles are married and I have 8 cousins on that side.  My mothers family is originally from here as well but has all since left the area (grandparents moved to a retirement community in AZ several years ago, uncle is career military currently stationed idk where, aunt (K) moved to AZ after graduating college for her career)  We are from a Midwest US state and are Caucasian.

This whole fiasco started when my older sister Lisa (22F) was in college back in spring of 2020.  Right before COVID shut down her college that March, she got pregnant after a party (she didnt know until after she was back home).  In fall 2020, my senior year of HS, I started my college application process while my pregnant sister lived at home.  Mike had finished school several years prior and had started his career about 90 min away from our hometown.  Lisa gave birth to twins a few days after Thanksgiving 2020.  In Jan 2021 I received my early acceptance to my dream school - nothing like Harvard but a highly rated “Public Ivy” in my state.  I had also gotten enough of a scholarship to cover the tuition (but not room/board).  Obviously I was ecstatic!  Unfortunately that was about to come crashing down.

In May 2021, my parents told me that I could not go to school and that I needed to stay home to raise my nieces while my sister went back to school since she needed to support her kids and thus needed a better education.  Much screaming ensued, with my father eventually telling me that his decision was final and that was that.  Well Mike learned what happened, called me and said “Yeah thats not happening” and we made plans.

I would like to take a moment to give a shout out to the Reddit posts back in early 2021 that discussed the steps to take and things/docs to gather in order to successfully leave home for good.  And thats what we did.  We had discussed plans a few times when he visited and took me out to lunch, and one day that July I had my essentials all packed, left a letter for our parents and after lunch we just went back to his apartment.

As you can imagine, the fallout was explosive.  Starting with angry calls and texts and lead to us both being disowned by the family for being “disloyal”.  MIke had predicted this and we were both prepared for it so it wasnt a surprise.  Anyway that August he paid my remaining school balance and dropped me off at my dorm and I have been living and studying here since then.  He has continued to pay my room/board and whatever else scholarships didnt cover ever since. I cannot thank him enough for what he has done for me.

Since then, we have had pretty much no contact with our parents, sister and all aunts/uncles and grandparents on dads side. I am still in contact with 2 cousins (F19, F17) who support me and think we made the right decision.   We do have contact with moms side, and have both flown out to AZ the last 2 holiday seasons to spend with them.  This past holiday is when Aunt K  first talked to me about her concerns for Mike that she noticed.  They are very close (she is only 3 years older than him and we all grew up together in our grandparents house) so they are like siblings and I guess she picked up on some things that were off.

The issue I need help with:   Aunt K and I have noticed him seemingly becoming more depressed and isolated and this is what I am hoping for some help in helping him.  Mike is somewhat introverted and has always had a very small social circle and a lot of his social outlet was with our extended paternal family.  There were family BBQs very often, especially during football season when it was pretty much weekly.  Throw in holidays, birthdays etc there was probably 2 big family events a month minimum.  Mike was able to attend most of those and he always tried to hang out with my dad and uncles even tho they always acted lukewarm to him.  With that now gone for the past 18 months, he hasnt really had that outlet. So please Reddit, any advice would be appreciated.  He gave me my life back and I need to find a way to do the same for him.  Thank you all.

Note:  I do plan on sharing this post with him when he visits me next weekend (my school is a 2 hr or so drive from where he lives so he meets me for lunch 2-3x per month).  I want to be able to sit down and read this through with him and talk with him about everything so thank you again.

Tl:dr:  My brother helped me escape life as a forced nanny and go to college, we both got disowned by family and he is becoming depressed, I am looking for ways to help him.

&#x200B;

ETA:  I saw a few comments below regarding our extended family so I thought I would add a couple notes:

My moms side totally supports what Mike and I have done.  We both talk to our grandparents and aunt regularly.  We have even visited them a few times in the past year in AZ.

From what I can gather on my dads side from talking with my cousins, some of the family dont think we are wrong and are just following my dads lead since he is the oldest sibling.  My uncles (dads brothers) are still very much supporting my dads point of view.

According to my aunt, my mom and sister both want to put this all behind us and move forward but my dad is being stubborn and wont let it go and they dont want to go behind his back.

The craziest thing to me is that my sister didnt even want to go back to her school!  My dad was going to force her to go back.  It boggles my mind still how they thought it would work out.

Growing up, our parents had always encouraged all 3 of us to pursue some kind of higher education after HS, either a traditional college or trade school.  So there wasnt really the gender dynamic of ""dad works, mom raises the kids"" in the extended family.  None of my aunts (or grandmothers for that matter) are traditional SAHMs.

I would also like to thank everyone who has commented so far.  I have shared this post with both my aunt K and some friends here who are aware of my situation.  Mike is still planning on coming down here on Saturday so I am hoping to update this after.",True
126,126,"Back when I was 18, I didn't have enough money to go to college. I also failed to get scholarships, since I was mostly average. I thought about taking out loans but an older guy in my neighbourhood told me how he still couldn't pay off his loans after five years. Enter Penny, who was 43 at the time.

She's the daughter of the company where my dad worked as a janitor. She's seen me around before since I was a young boy and asked me why I was looking so glum. I told her what was on my mind and she said she'd pay me for sex. I said yes. Somehow it ended up turning into a real relationship after I graduated. She no longer paid me for sex since I became her boyfriend. Few years after I graduated and got a job, we married.

When my wife told my friends how we met, they all accuse her of having groomed me. How do I get them to stop? Or is it impossible to stop them? Is cutting them off the only choice I've got?","Tldr: My family are uncomfortable that I'm in a relationship with a man. He's not invited for Christmas, obviously this means I won't be going either but I don't know how to explain to him without hurting him or making him feel guilty. 

My fiancé and I are men in our early 30s. He's the first man I've had feelings for or been in a serious relationship with which could be relevant. We were friends first and my family LOVED him. They actually invited him for Christmas when we were friends so I know this isn't about anything other than disapproving of our relationship. 

Christmas is a big deal in my family, the whole extended family is there including partners. I automatically assumed my partner would be there. My family were awkward about our relationship at first but I really thought they were coming around. However, my mum (who always hosts) has told me he isn't invited because older relatives wouldn't be comfortable and it might ruin the day. I'm from quite a typical african family and they aren't exactly open-minded. My parents aren't too bad but they are very image-conscious. My siblings are a mixed bag. 

My fiancé and I haven't really discussed Christmas so it's not as though I'd told him he's coming and he was excited about it or anything. I was kind of excited though. I'm disappointed that it won't be happening but I'm even more disappointed that my family don't accept us. Obviously I'm not going without him. I told my mum this but she thinks I'm being silly and will change my mind. 

I don't know how to tell my fiancé. He's going to be so hurt and when I tell him I'm not going either he's going to feel guilty. Any time my friends or family have had an issue with us being together, he's just ended up feeling bad because he feels like he's causing problems in my relationships. I know he's going to say he wants me to go to my family Christmas without him. Christmas is already a difficult time for him because he has no family, literally none. I think this situation is going to make him feel even worse. 

I don't know what the best way is to handle it. I don't think there's any way to avoid hurting him but I want to at least make it easier on him. I was wondering about us maybe going away somewhere but that might make him feel guilty too. Any advice would be appreciated.",True
127,127,"To say I was mad as hell would be an understatement. I (46M) have a son Jake (23M & Fake Name). Jake was a good kid growing up. So him doing this was a complete shock to me. I have a daughter too, Amber (16F & Also Fake Name). When my wife passed away from Covid nearly two years ago, she already had a will in place. She was immunocompromised due to a prior condition she was diagnosed with a decade before she passed. And she made sure she had a will set just in case anything happened to her. And in said will she divided her assets between our children. And Jake got his cut as he was already 21. He used that money to put a down payment on a condo, and he also got his mother's car. But the will stated that my daughter was to get all of my wife's jewelry. That included a vintage gold ring with a diamond that had a light blue sapphire on each side of it. That ring has been passed down for generations in my wife's family. It was originally her grandmother's wedding band. Her husband was a jeweler and hand crafted the ring for her himself. And it was passed down to my wife's mother when her grandmother died, and then to my wife herself when her mother passed. And it along with the other jewelry was to all go to my daughter.

When my wife passed away, my grief was intense. But I powered through it for the sake of my family. And they supported me 100%. So the betrayal from my son was just a rusty knife in the back to me. For the past eight months Jake has been dating Sara (Fake name). She has my son wrapped around her finger. And she loves jewelry as she adorns herself with it a lot. My son mentioned the family jewels my wife left his sister to Sara one day, and Sara really wanted to see them. So Jake went into my room when no one was home and showed them to her. He later admitted to me that he'd done this, and I was angry. But I thought that would be the end of it. I was wrong. Jake came to me a week ago and begged for that ring from his mother's family jewels so that he could propose with it. He said Sara had fallen in love with the ring when she saw it before, and he just knew it'd be the perfect ring to ask her to marry him with. He seemed completely convinced I'd be jumping for joy for him wanting to propose. But instead, I told him that I was not the one to ask as the ring belongs to Amber. And I wouldn't have him pressuring her to give it up it either. For a fair chance, I'd allow him to explain his reasons and ask her for it once. But only once. Without pressuring her. And if she refuses for any reason, that will be the end of it. Jake agreed and asked Amber for the ring right in front of me. But she told him no because she wanted to keep it in the family jewels, and has always loved that ring. To her, it's priceless. She couldn't bear to ever give it up. I told Jake that was that, and to not press the matter further.

Jake left looking very unhappy about not getting the ring. But I thought he'd let it go and look into finding a similar one. But he came back another day while I was at work to talk to his sister after she got home from school. He and Amber got into a huge fight about the ring and Amber called me crying. I called Jake and told him to get out of my house and leave his sister alone. Jake yelled at me that he should have just as much right to the ring as his sister, because my wife was his mother too. But I reminded him he got a lot of his mother's money, and her car. The jewelry is Amber's, and only hers. He hung up on me and Amber soon texted me that he left very angry.

Later right before I left work, my daughter called and told me that Jake came back. He walked in dressed in a suit, went into my room and took something. Then left without saying anything to Amber. She tried to keep him from leaving, but he shoved her out of the way. I rushed home as soon as my shift was over and checked my wife's jewelry box. The ring was gone. I immediately called Jake, but he didn't answer. So I messaged him that I'll get police involved if he doesn't return the ring. Using it to propose won't stop me from taking it back. That finally made him talk to me, and he tried to say that I couldn't do that to him because he's my son. I said I can and will because he outright stole the ring. And he'd better bring it back right away, or I would take drastic measures. Well he phoned me right after that, and in a whisper he said that it was too late. He'd taken his girlfriend out to dinner and proposed to her with the ring. He hadn't had it for more than an hour by this point. Yet the ring was already on her finger. I said that was his problem. He stole the ring, he can bring it back. It's not his, and I will do whatever it takes to make sure it's returned. And if that means going to police and blowing the whole situation up, then so be it. I'll file a report, I'll even get a lawyer. Jake started crying and saying I couldn't do this to him. I told him tough luck. He stole from both his sister and dead mother. I would not back down until the ring was returned.

Jake wouldn't stop crying and making excuses. So I told him to have the ring back by morning, or I would be moving forward with legal action. Jake is my son, but he still broke the law. And I couldn't overlook what he did. He said he'd be by in the morning to talk, and ended the call while crying even more. Well Jake did show up in the morning, and brought his girlfriend with him to try and guilt us. Turns out she not only knew he stole the ring, she wanted to keep it anyway. Because she was completely in love with the ring since she first laid eyes on it. I told her I didn't care. She could have a jeweler make a copy of it or something. But the original doesn't belong to her, it belongs to my daughter and deceased wife. Jake begged me one more time not to make her give it back. But I and my daughter stood firm. Return the ring or face police and maybe even a potential lawsuit. Jake's girlfriend pulled the ring off her finger and dropped it in my daughter's hands, called me an evil bastard, then left my house in tears. Jake started screaming at me that I may have just destroyed his relationship. I retorted him that he did this to his own relationship by stealing a ring that didn't belong to him. What kind of son steals from his own sister and dead mother? That is beyond terrible! Jake had nothing more to say to me and walked out to follow after his girlfriend.

I didn't get anyone else involved in the situation. But Jake did. He tried getting support from friends and family. But he got the exact opposite reaction he'd hoped for. They were all mad at him over what he'd done. I got many phone calls and message from people offering me condolences and saying they were not on Jake's side. I tried to do damage control. But now everybody knows. It's been a week now, and Jake's refused to speak to me. I've sent him detailed pictures of the ring, just in case he wanted a jeweler to replicate it. But making a copy would be very expensive unless he used fake stones. And thus far there has been no response. I don't know what the situation is with his girlfriend. If she even still is his girlfriend after what happened. But I still stand by the fact that Jake had to return the ring. I have since had all my wife's jewelry placed in a safety deposit box that only I have access to. And the jewelry will remain there until my daughter is 21. And may even stay there if she wants to keep it safe that way.

I know I'm in the right to have reclaimed the ring. However I don't want my son to hate me. And I don't want the family to hate him. If anyone has any advice as to how to better mediate this situation without me giving away the ring or spending a lot of money, I'm all ears. 

Edit: Fixed a slight name mix-up. ","Hi. I'm sorry for my spelling as English is not my first language. Me (27F) and my BF (28M) have been together since we were 20 y/o and for the most part our relationship was pretty good. We can comunicate pretty well our wants and needs so it's been a very healthy relationship.

A couple of days ago I noticed something was bothering him and I asked. He said he doesn't feel as good as he used to. He's not ok with where he is now in his life. He doesn't like his job, his economics, his life basically. The only thing he said is good in his life is me, and that doesn't make him feel fulfilled.

We've been talking nonstop this past few days, also we have cried too much. At the beginning I was scared because I didn't want the relationship to end but the more we talk the more I feel I don't deserve this situation. I know is not a me problem, is him, his life, his goals. I cannot think for him, I can't be happy for him.

I'm exhausted, at the end of every conversation he ends up telling me that even though he wants to discover himself, the only thing he's sure is that he doesn't wanna live without me, but then the next morning he wakes up confused with what he wants again. He's came up with this idea of take a 1 year long ""break"" so he can find himself and then come back to me.

I honestly think that's awful, and I told him that I love him so much and probably in a year I will still love him the same but I don't deserve that, I won't be sitting with my arms folded just waiting, I'll probable recent him a lot, so that won't work for me. If he stays he stays and commit to work things out in therapy, and if he leaves it's done.

He said the most important thing for him is my happiness and I deserve a concrete answer of what his choice will be, he wants time to think about it, like a month. But now I'm asking myself what do I want? Honestly him pulling this stunt destroyed somehow a little of my trust in him, so I don't know if now should I leave either way.

&#x200B;

TL;DR: My bf of seven years is confused about what he wants in like and wants to take a 1 year long break, now I'm dissapointed and asking myself if I should leave the him.",True
128,128,"I contacted the police, and they basically did regular procedural stuff, like file a report, tell me about the process of getting a warrant, and we had some lighthearted jokes about the incident. I kept the tracker open on my phone, and midway through conversation the tracker starts ticking downwards.

I quietly turned my phone to the police, not really knowing what to do, and before anything could happen, the door swings open. It was some dude from my CS class, super tall (like 6’3 to my 4’11)  and quiet, was overall harmless (except for the fact he always reeked of cat piss).

Almost instantly, he charged at me and slammed me into the wall with an ungodly strength, which I felt my something break (now known clavicle) and an unbearable amount of pain. The police officer chased after him, and I just kinda sat there wide eyed touching my chest in pain.

Some other students heard the commotion and called 911 for an ambulance, because I was just looking at everyone, wheezing, and not responding.

Kinda blanked out after that. Now I’m waiting for some kind of surgery to fix my shit. Idk what’s gonna happen after this, but thanks for the advice from the previous post. I’d like to ask what I should do next, after I finish all this hospital jazz.

And yes. I have my MacBook + stuff back lol, it was not sold.

EDIT: I’m not gonna reply for a while, since I have to undergo surgery. I’m still kind of dazed. I’ll hopefully have more answers in a few days (or weeks). Thanks for the majority of you being kind and supportive. I appreciate it :)","I’ve been with my husband for 3 years, recently married. I’m in a demanding healthcare program. I graduate soon, and I would say now is the toughest and most demanding time. I also work, so in between school, my job, cooking, cleaning, studying, I’m stretched thin. 

My husband doesn’t understand how much the program takes from me. When we have our hospital clinicals (14 hour days), I am dead tired when I get home. All I have energy for is eating, doing the dishes, and then sleeping. 

For example, this week I had two 14 hour days in a row. I also didn’t sleep much because we had two exams this week. My husband has been telling me he wants to spend more time with me. When I got home yesterday, we went on a walk and went out to a restaurant. 

When I got home, I told him I was exhausted and headed to bed. He got upset, said “I thought we were going to spend time together and watch tv.” I told him that I was so tired I couldn’t think. He responded “we all have jobs, we’re all tired.”

I was a little upset that he didn’t want me to rest, but I thought maybe he’s been lonely because I’m so busy so I told him we could cuddle and watch tv in bed. He started kissing me, and I was so tired so I kind of pulled back but kept hugging him. He got upset and said “we haven’t been intimate in four days.”

I’ve been on my period and also at the hospital so much, normally we have sex every day sometimes multiple times a day. I think this is the longest stretch we’ve gone. At this point I was really upset with him, and told him to leave me alone so I could go to sleep. 

I don’t know what to do. I feel like I’m on the verge of a mental break. This past weekend we went on walks together, went to a couple of dinners, did sports together, and went to a concert. I feel like I’m giving every ounce of myself that I can. 

How can I get through to him that I am burnt out, and convey how difficult my program is?

TLDR: I’m in a tough school program, and frequently exhausted. I’m trying as hard as I can to give attention to my husband, how can I help him understand I need rest?",True
129,129,"A week ago he (40m) picked me (15f) up from school and then started to stare at me but at my chest, i told him to focus on the road and he did until he pulled over and put his hand on my thigh and started to go up to my crotch, I got really frightened then he stopped and went back home like nothing happened. I stayed in my room the whole day after that and felt scared whenever i was around him, he later came to me and apologized and said if i ever told anyone it would be my fault if he got in trouble, so i kept shut about it. Then the day after that he did it again but put his hand my t shirt and touched my boobs saying he was giving me a massage, I tried to get away from him and show discomfort but he wouldn’t let go, i was shaking after that. I don’t know what to do because everyone sees him as a good man and wouldn’t believe me","Tldr: I feel like I’m too old to be dealing with paranoia about girls and dm’s and inappropriate texts and all that, especially when I’m 34 and want something serious that leads to a family. I need to trust my partner.

My boyfriend and I are in our mid 30’s. we’ve been dating a year. He joined some recreational sports this summer and has been talking about his teammates enough for me to remember names. Last weekend I asked to charge my phone on his charger so I pulled his phone off the charger to put mine in and I saw a name. ‘Felicia’. I can’t see what the message said because it needs to be unlocked. I thought it was odd that this girl that he just met a couple weeks prior from baseball was texting him directly, so I checked his instagram on a hunch. They are following each other already…. Which is totally fine normally, right? Except he didn’t follow ANY of his other new teammates - male or female. I looked through her profile and it… explains a lot. Typical cringey influencer hope-to-make-it-one-day via extremely suggestive, nearly nude photos and embarrassing captions ie asking her followers to ‘imagine going on a date with her’… I’m not exaggerating that line either.

After I felt sad but I did it to myself because I wanted to play FBI agent.

So I come to his house to see him this weekend. I get the urge to click on the home button of his iPad and I peek. I can see who messages him and what they say right on the Lock Screen. It is not hidden. I guess he has not opened his iPad for at least a day because I’m seeing instagram DM’s from Felicia- they were chatting back and forth *past* midnight! I can only see her responses from the Home Screen which she says things like “oh I’m not sure what my favourite song is” “what happened with your dad anyway is he still around?” “So why haven’t you moved in with your girlfriend yet?”, she asked him how much money he makes, and then at approx 1am she goes “Omg it’s almost 1 go to sleep! Haha. Troublemaker” 

…They. Just. Met. 

Keep in mind we always say good night around 10-11pm because he gets up at 6am for work. I messaged him that night at around 11pm and he didn’t respond so I assumed he was sleeping…. Why would he not be? As a matter of fact, he ignored THREE of my texts while he was blasting off dm’s to Felicia.

Is this straight up cheating? No, but I think it’s inappropriate. 

Am I wrong? I just have alarm bells going off because if I  imagining myself married to this dude, maybe a couple babies, and I am at my most vulnerable state mentally and need him the most… and if this ‘situation’ with another instagram Felicia occurred at that point, I would have a mental break

Is this something we can work through or is this a character flaw? Or are we just mismatched? I’m wondering if I’m being paranoid or jealous and maybe I should work on that? I don’t want either of us to make excuses so I think that’s why I want to talk to strangers on the internet… I don’t trust my mind and decision making right now. I don’t know what the right thing is.

**Update:** I am absolutely overwhelmed with all the thoughtful responses. You all read my story and took time out of your day to help a stranger. Thank you. I’ve read them all. I talked to him in the morning about it and how I feel it’s disrespectful, and that I need him to know when to draw boundaries with new single women to protect our relationship. He said he wanted time to think about everything because he isn’t great at tough discussions. He can’t get his thoughts/feelings out properly. I know that about him. 

Now, we wait… I told him to reach out when he has something to say. it’s been 7 hours since I left his house.

**Update 2:** we smoothed things over a couple days later. He initially said he didn’t think he was doing anything wrong so I had to make examples to finally get him to admit he KNOWS boundaries he just chooses to ignore them when it comes to our relationship! I asked him if he would try to text his best friends girlfriend  and have that exact convo (that he had with Felicia) with her til 1am without his friends knowledge. That was the only way he could finally see where I was coming from. It was disappointing that I had to do that when he had a whole weekend to think about it.

Two weeks after that, he picks a fight over something that could’ve easily been resolved (I was ‘too quiet’ during a gathering with his friends, and he told me after that he didn’t like the unfriendly impression that gave them. I apologized profusely for having a bad day and offered to pay for the food/drinks he bought us), and then he broke up with me at the end of the night.

It came out of nowhere, so I think he was using this minor issue to blow up and give himself a reason to break up with me. He had never yelled at me like that before or been so cruel. It turned Into lots of gaslighting toward me about situations that were either partially or completely fabricated. It was bizarre, frankly. I assume he thought he made better points than he did because he was quite inebriated and didn’t realize I was quite sober (I don’t really drink because of a family history of alcoholism). I did not feel safe at the end just before I walked out the door. He was screaming in my face with crazy eyes. I had never seen this version of him- a monster. I knew I’d never see him again after that, so I proceeded to give him a couple reasons why I thought breaking up really was for the best (Long story short I caught him in some serious lies), and walked out. 

I don’t know for sure what the real reason behind him going postal on me and breaking up with me was (Felicia? Someone else? Life? Me?), but it doesn’t really matter now I suppose. I’m going to focus on healing myself the rest of this summer. Thank you all for your thoughtful responses.

**Update 3:** it’s been two weeks since he told me to get out of his life. Honestly, I feel relieved. The first week was awful. Every day was agony even though I knew he wasn’t good for me. This week was better, and yesterday was the first day I could say I felt great. I have a new routine to replace when I would’ve been with him, able to hit the gym even more, taking myself to dates and catching up with my best friends in the world. They have busy lives with their own families but made time for me while I’m in need. So grateful.",True
130,130,"My “best friend” (i don’t really want to call her that anymore) told me that she raped her ex boyfriend. I didn’t ask or anything. I got to school, met her, and the first thing she said was “I went home to him yesterday and forced him to do it”. 

I was under the impression that she had gotten over him, or that she was at least trying to. He was really uncomfortable in the end of their relationship so he broke it off and said he didn’t want any contact with her. During the aftermath of their relationship ending she was constantly crossing boundaries, but she hadn’t done it in a while. So she has a history of doing too much and making people uncomfortable. 

At first I didn’t really know how to react. She said something along the lines of “I’m so stupid” and I agreed with her. Then she started saying things like “Can you just tell me this is a dream” “I mean people who have been abused can turn into the abuser” “I was manic or something it wasn’t really me” etc. and I told her that she’s just trying to make excuses and that she has to face the consequences. Then she started talking about future jobs, so I told her that she was being selfish. 

But I didn’t really say anything else. I honestly don’t know what to say. I’ve always thought that I would stop being friends with someone if something like that was ever revealed, but now I don’t know. 

I’m in the same class as her (we graduate this summer) and we are in the same friend group. So I don’t know what i’m supposed to do. 

What would you do in my situation?

Edit: Just to clarify, their genders don’t have anything to do with the situation. I am having a hard time because this was a person I thought I could trust and that I thought could never harm another person in this way. Having a (now former) friend admit to raping someone isn’t exactly easy to process. That is why I needed advice. I would still need advice if it was a guy I was really close to that raped a girl.

Edit2: I got the ex’s snap, i’ll be speaking to him and doing my best to support him in whatever decision he chooses. I am also doing my best to distance myself from the girl. Also something fucked up I learnt today, the girl told her guardian about what she did and her guardian simply said “it’s not that important. just ignore what you did and focus on school”.","Girlfriend and I live together, and both work from home. Our sex life is good, having sex or similar activities once or twice a week or so on average. I usually initiate it and tell her that if there are times she’s in the mood that I haven’t initiated, she is welcome to start something and I will usually be happy to go along. However, she is really bad at it, and then is upset when I “reject her.” Here are some examples:


I’m working in the office, GF comes in and says “hey is there anything you want for lunch?” And I say “idk I’ll probably make pasta or a sandwich or something”. She then looks disappointed and leaves. The rest of the day, she is pouty and sad. I ask what’s up and she says that eating lunch was supposed to be code for having sex during our lunch break.


After work, I usually do chores for a bit before we work on dinner. I was washing dishes when GF came back from the store. She says “I’m gonna go change” because she is wearing normal clothes and prefers to wear sweatpants-type stuff when lounging around the house. I say ok and she goes into the bedroom with the door closed. I do chores for like ten minutes and then she comes out of the room all annoyed, saying that she wanted me to come in while she was changing and start sexy times. How was I supposed to know that? Changing after getting home is not an abnormal thing to me.


GF goes for a bike ride and gets home all sweaty. She says she’s going to shower, I’m like ok cool. When she is done, she says that she is disappointed I didn’t come join her in the shower. This is despite our shower not being very roomy and her turning me down for shower activity together in the past, explicitly because there’s not much room for 2 people.


I have told her that she needs to be more direct if she wants to signal that she wants sex, but she is not getting better and it is quite frustrating when she starts pouting just because I don’t pick up on the signals. She has said that she wants the person that she is with to just know when she’s in the mood, but I am not a mind reader and feel like she’s saying things that people might say all the time in a normal setting. How can I improve this?

•I had a daughter out of wedlock when I was a teen  

• I’m black (but he’s black too) 

•I’ve been having infertility issues 

•I’m 134 LBs (I’m a few pounds overweight, I’m 5’0) and I’m average looking 

•I have nothing valuable to offer 

I know I don’t deserve this kind of treatment. It’s hard for me to leave because we’ve been together for so long. We’ve known each other even longer. We even own a house together. He wants to be with me but only as bf/gf because he says he will never see me as wife material. This hurts me so much.","TLDR:I invited my ILs to spend the Christmas at a beach resort and now, all of my siblings are mad at me.

We lost my late BIL, Gabriel(17M) to glioblastoma last May. It is a really aggressive brain tumor and I was mostly at my ILs house for 2021-beginning of 2022, helping them to take care of him. He was one of the kindest, sweetest and the most charming person you could ever meet. My husband(32M) and I(33F) still mourn and most probably will always mourn because we are together since my husband is 14,we witnessed Gabriel saying his first words, I was there when he went to school first time in his life, he was my man of honor at our wedding 2 years ago, I was the one who sew him his prom suit(I do it as a hobby) and he was just a big part of our life. I also love my ILs till death, I am so grateful they raised my husband to be such a gentleman and if it wasn't MIL,I most probably wouldn't be alive till this day.

With my family though, things were complicated. My parents tried their best to raise us but we are 7 siblings, I am the middle and I wasn't a troublesome one, so most of the time I was left to my own devices. But my parents were always behind my back when I called them, it was just easier to call my ILs. My siblings also had their own dynamics and me spending most of my time in my ILs since high school was a part of that I should admit.

This year, me and my husband decided to invite my ILs to a vacation. We thought they needed a change of scenery and after they said ""Yes"", we booked the flights, found a beach resort last-minute and we are flying to Canary Islands at Saturday and we will spend our time until January 2nd in a beach resort.

We didn't tell anyone until 2 days ago so we could finalize or plan. At Saturday, we called my parents and told them the plan. They said it was a good idea and it would be good for us and them.They also said they would speak with my siblings. She told them I wouldn't be present because I was taking my ILs to vacation. After this, I got a dozens of text messages saying I am neglecting them, I was always absent and I never cared for my family. I know my mom and dad will tear them apart if I show them these messages but I don't want to play the nuclear card and destroy everything so,what should Ido?",True
132,132,"So, I know this is a weird question, but my boyfriend likes to spend a lot of his free time digging a tunnel on some property that he inherited. I haven't seen the full extent of it, but last I saw it was remarkably deep under the surface. He's spent roughly a year on it, and it's evident. The front of the thing is deep, wide, well put together. At the front, which is the only part that I've seen, he's got cement beams, electric lights, even chairs and a small table. I haven't gone into it, but it looked like the quality severely dropped as the tunnel went further, mostly becoming open dirt with some wood beams holding it up.

My biggest concern is his safety, I'm really worried that he's going to dig too deep and it'll collapse on him or something. I've tried voicing this concern to him, but he just laughs it off and assures me that he'll be fine. Aside from safety concerns, there's also the fact that he doesn't really have a social life, because of this thing. I'm pretty much the only person he still talks to outside of his job, and he doesn't go out and do anything anymore. It used to be that he'd occasionally head out and do some digging on the weekends, but now he spends almost all of his free time out there. He still comes home, but he barely spends any time with me, and I know that he isn't doing anything but digging that damn hole in the ground. This can't be good for his mental health, but I don't know how to convince him to stop. He's always really happy when he comes back from digging, which is why I haven't seriously tried to stop him before, but I was talking to a friend about him, and she told me he might be going crazy. Obviously I don't think he's insane, but I hadn't considered the mental health aspect of this, and I just don't know what to do.

TLDR: Boyfriend spends all of his time digging a tunnel, and I'm worried for both his physical and mental health","My husband and I have been very good friends with someone for 10 years and I was friends with him for 7 years prior to that as well. He has a history of being in very troubled and abusive relationships (where he is 100% the victim) and unfortunately ended up marrying a monstrous woman, who had been married twice before and has 1 child from each ex. She brags that she is an awful and abusive mother and is saving up for their future therapy because she doesn’t want to change, but I digress. 

I am mixed race and she says horrifically racist things all the time around me, tries to hit on my husband and makes him uncomfortable, is cruel to everyone around her and extremely cruel to him. She was aggressive and violent the night before their wedding and on their wedding night yelled about how she regretted marrying such a loser, has made him sleep in his car after a fight, etc. His family and other friends also hate her for the same reasons and we’ve all discussed that we’re fearful for him and her children. 

He is so beaten down by all of these past relationships and won’t go to therapy and just sort of disassociates and pretends everything is fine when it clearly isn’t. I’m finally done trying to tolerate her and refuse to be around her anymore or expose my baby daughter to someone like her. I’m just looking for suggestions in dealing with this in a way where I don’t lose his friendship, but don’t have to see his wife anymore, though I’m also willing to accept it’s not possible.

TLDR: my best friends wife is awful and I don’t know how to tell him I won’t see her anymore.",True
133,133,"I just found out that both of my friends (both F14) are dating grown-ass adults (one M20 the other M25). 

When I found out I freaked out and told them that they shouldn't be dating adults and that they should keep far away from them as possible because they're most definitely likely pedophiles. Both of them told me that there was nothing wrong with that and that I'm overreacting, and that it was normal to date older men, one of them said that these days it's normal for a 10 yo to date a 35 yo which made me feel sick to my stomach. 

I tried to reason with them about how it was straight-up creepy and illegal, but they weren't listening because they thought that dating an older man was cool and that it made them baddies. Even one of them said that it's called having daddy issues (one of my friends has a really bad relationship with her father cause he's a huge POS).

I almost cried after that conversation because I'm worried for them and I know that I will blame myself for the rest of my life if something happens to them because I couldn't protect them, I know it's probably wrong to feel this way but they're the only good thing in my life that I have left and I don't want anything bad to happen to them. What should I do?

(I will also try to ask my mom for advice but I'm not sure if she will be able to help me)

Edit: I made an update, you can check it on my profile or in the comments :)","
20F, 20M, been dating for 1 year

About a month ago my boyfriend brought up plans to go to his favourite country for a few days to see his favourite band with his female best friend who also likes said band. 

I thought it was odd that I wasn’t included in the plans but I brushed it off as maybe he just forgot to ask. Then after about the third or fourth time he brought it up it became clear that not only was he not going to ask, he probably never even imagined me there in the first place. I told him this upset me and he sheepishly invited me. 

I don’t like the band but he and bff would be doing other stuff whilst they were there, PLUS this band would have been touring in our country at a later date so I don’t know why he didn’t invite me to his dream holiday and then do the concert with bff at a later date? 

Other subs have been very divided on this but I lowkey feel like he’s crossing a line here. I don’t want to be that controlling gf who doesn’t let her bf have any friends and is super jealous but I also don’t want him to think he can disrespect relationship boundaries. 

What are my next moves? Apart from saying “just break up” 

Tl;dr boyfriend is planning dream holiday with female best friend and I was only invited after I brought it up. It feels weirdly intimate and I’m not happy with it

Edit: I’m going to delete this soon bc I don’t want him to see it (he has Reddit lol). We talked and he agreed that he wouldn’t be happy if the situation was reversed so I’m not entirely sure where things are gonna go from here. We’ll talk properly in person in a couple of days.",True
134,134,"He loves oral sex....and I mean love loves it. Giving blow jobs is very new to me, but obviously I want to make my partner happy as he does me. He says I'm amazing at it and all he wants to do is shoot load after load in my mouth. Communication for the most part is really good, we have a safe word when things get too intense for one of us (usually me) and we will even tap out. Before, as soon as I would either say the word or tap out he'd back off instantly. Now, say I start gagging on him, I'll try pulling him out but he grabs my chin, gives me a smack across the face and puts it back inside telling me to go further. I've flat out told him no before and tried turning away or getting up. He spits in my mouth and chokes me telling me how I need to be punished for not listening . He'll slap my face, my breasts, and butt (which I know is normal for alot of guys to do) and he'll downright scare me. Once he's done though, he's back to being my sweet and loving boyfriend....it's almost like a light switch. I know people get really into it when things start getting really passionate. Am I just overreacting, and as my mom tells me should just be grateful that I actually found someone who is willing to be with me?"," 

My friend (let's call her Meg) has been bringing her cousin around to hangout with our friend group for the last couple of months. Every time the cousin comes to hang out, we spark great chemistry and always end up talking all night. One night, we were out and eventually were kissing. After that night, I decided to ask the cousin out to hang but she told me she couldn't due to work. Flashback to a few days ago, and the cousin comes to hang out again. Again, great chemistry and we talked non-stop. She told me to text her that night to hang sometime. So, the next day I texted her to hang but again she said that she couldn't because she was busy with work.

Now comes in my friend (Meg) and my best friend (let's call her Lisa). My best friend Lisa informed me that the cousin talked to her the last night we all hung out. The cousin told my best friend Lisa that she likes me and wants to hangout but can't because her cousin (Meg) has a crush on me. I have known Meg for a very long time, and no one has ever known in the friend group that she liked me. I didn't expect this, as I don't have any romantic feelings toward her at all and feel like I barley even talk to her. I want to go on a date with the cousin, but now it's all messed up because the cousin is scared to go on a date with me because she doesn't want to upset Meg (her cousin, my friend).

I decided to stop asking the cousin to hang as I realized her two excuses of ""having to work"" were said because she is worried to hangout with me since her cousin likes me. How do I handle this? I really like this girl and I can tell she really likes me, but there's a big roadblock in the way of my friend having a crush on me.

TL;DR I have great chemistry with my friends cousin. We both want to hang out. My friend told my cousin that she likes me. I never knew that, and I also have no romantic feelings for my friend at all. The cousin is scared to hangout with me because she doesn't want to hurt her cousins feelings. Is there a way to handle this mess?",True
135,135,I wanted to be honest with him and tell him I wasn’t satisfied. I’ve only made myself finish. He basically said either I’m a lesbian or I need to go have sex with someone else who is bigger. Then he proceeded to tell me he enjoys jerking off more anyways. I just wanted to have an open conversation and talk about what we could do differently. What should I do,"The title is a bit dramatic, it is more complicated than that sounds. So I (20F) have lived with my friend 'Dan' (20M) since the start of this year, we have been friends since university started three years ago. 

Before living together, we spoke about noise at night and how Dan did not appreciate how his old roommate used to make noodles at 2am before his lectures, and I of course said that I would have no issues with not doing that. Since moving in together, Dan has had issues with me not being quiet when brushing my teeth at 2am. So I started tiptoeing and quietly opening and closing the bathroom door. We have a third roommate (21F) who is also friends with both of us, none of this is  a problem for her as she is a deep-ish sleeper.

My only issue is that recently, Dan has been saying that he does not want me to leave my room for any reason at all after midnight. He has stated that due to his (very much legitimate) childhood trauma he does not get woken up by the loud noises outside (we live in the city), but will get woken up by my very quiet footsteps. 

I have been trying my absolute best to brush my teeth earlier and not have any reason to leave my room after midnight, despite my usual bedtime being 2am. I would of course change my bedtime or just remember to brush my teeth earlier (and often do), but it is extremely difficult for me due to my (recently diagnosed, yet to be medicated) ADHD. The ADHD means that I often don't remember to brush my teeth earlier and I can't go to bed earlier as I can't study without the pressure of it being late at night.

I have suggested many times that he uses a white noise machine, earplugs, or sees a doctor. He hasn't looked into if a white noise machine would work, does not want to be using earplugs every night because he doesn't want to rely on them, and he claims that because it is due to trauma he needs to see a therapist instead of a doctor (but has not put the effort in to seeing a therapist).

For more context, also due to his childhood trauma, my friend has been improving but is generally not great at roommate things (ie doing dishes, cleaning things). I of course understand how this stuff can be hard (because of my ADHD), but it feels more difficult for me to try really hard to change my routines around if he can't do things like take the bins out. Dan has also recently been in the living room at 1am, has an ensuite, and has a similar bedtime to me except when he has to wake up at 7am for work.

'Dan' if you're seeing this hey whats up I want to know if random internet people have any ideas what we can do

TLDR: I don't know how to compromise with my roommate/friend who can't deal with me brushing my teeth after midnight when there isn't really any way for me to never go outside my room at night (mostly because of my ADHD).",True
136,136,"Burner account because he follows me on my main. Firstly ill go through how i found out he was texting her. Last week on Friday my sister was sitting on the couch and i had walked up behind her to ask her if she had seen my airpods since i couldn't find them and she has a history of taking them from me and hiding them.

She has the enlarged text on her phone for some reason i dont know, but i saw a text when i started talking to her and asked her where my airpods were but half way through what i was saying, i paused because i saw a text that read ""Have they had the talk with you in health yet"". i was behind her as she was sitting on the couch so thats why i was able to read the text. as i said before, i paused half way through my sentence and asked her who she was texting.

Were going to call this friend Harry because i fucking hate the name Harry. she said with no hesitation, Harry (not actually harry but the dudes name). i honestly was at a loss for words. Harry had been my friend since 4th grade and he only had her number since he went with our family to a water park over the summer and at some point i dont remember why, needed her phone number, i didnt even remember he had it until now. i stuttered saying, ""why is he asking you that?"" while taking her phone from her to read the text. i asked her if she meant my friend Harry and she said ""Yeah"" excitedly. ""Whats wrong"". i tell her to shut up as im scrolling through the texts.

they just kept going. he had been talking to her for at least a week or two. i texted him on her phone while she was still asking me whats wrong and what i was doing. i texted back saying something like ""dinners ready ill text you soon"" and thank fuck she let didnt think twice about it and went on her ipad that was on the coffee table next to the couch. im in my room right now with her phone watching to see if he texts her back. i dont know what to do. from the texts i read while scrolling he was talking to her like he would talk to a woman. sexual texts. i didnt even look at them hard enough to see he was asking her if she knew what ""69 meant"" and ""the joke behind it"". He knows shes 10. My parents arent home and wont be til the morning as i am babysitting her and my other little sister whos 13 while theyre gone. im worried to text them about it cause i dont want to worry them. im telling them whenever i get the chance tmrw but for the time being, what do it do? Do i text him and ask him something? do i confront him in person? I dont know what to do.

&#x200B;

Putting the update here because it was lost in the comments.

UPDATE as of today.

To answer a couple questions, the only reason we were home and not at school is because the school had a major leak of some sort when it snowed, so it was closed the entire week, which is why my parents went on a little vacation where they'd go stay at a hotel for a couple days while i stayed at home babysitting my younger sisters. The middle school and high school were cancelled for the week, i know the highschool had a leak but i dont know about the middle school where she goes, but im assuming a similar situation happened at the middle school so they cancelled school for the week for both schools.

Our parents got home around 11:45am and i had told them i needed to talk to them as soon as possible. I showed them the texts and he had even texted her again asking her why she hadnt been responding to her earlier in the morning. i didnt respond to it. i took her phone for the night and when our parents got home, as soon as i could i told them about it and my dad i can tell you this, would have gone to jail if my mom wasnt there to stop him from leaving the room. he was pissed off more then id ever seen him as i was scrolling threw the texts with them. my mom was more just wondering what we would do at that point.

My dad contacted Harry's dad and told him all of it and rightfully, he was angry too. I mean his dad and my dad had been good friends for a while because of me and Harrys friendship. theyve both agreed to not let it effect their friendship but would still be taking it serious. Harrys parents have spoken to him about it and i have yet to ask if they found anything else on his phone, since they did mention they were going to go through his phone and check out what he had been doing. Scrolling to the start of the texts, he had texted her first on January 21st. so he had been talking to her for a WHILE before i found out. talking to her about very sexual things, things i bet he wouldnt have asked his girlfriend, not saying he had one im just saying if he had one. hes never had one hes about 125 pounds and 5'7. i tower over him. i dont think ive ever seen him have more then a 15 second conversation with a girl. other then my 10 year old little sister.

sorry for the update being almost as long as the whole story, its just so much has been happening but at the same time not to much, were contacting the school and police station tomorrow morning. My sister hasnt thought much of it, thank you to one of you, i couldnt find the comment but it was to tell her that the phone needed to be fixed and that it was being fixed for a couple days so that we'd be able to have it. and yes. all of it had been screenshotted even though it is unable to be deleted. also really didnt expect over 105,000 people to read this. its really helped me through all of it.

EDIT because i forgot to mention this. Yes, he did admit to talking to her first and enguaging in conversation with her. its mainly a parents thing at this point with the police and such.","Original post

UPDATE:

I (27F) was blown away by all your advice and responses so I just wanted to update you all- I followed the advice of the majority on here and let my former friend (23F) down as gently as possible.

I told her how sorry I am for her loss and that I can’t imagine how hard things are for her but I couldn’t see us going back to the way we were. 
I said how a lot of hurtful stuff went on and how I don’t think I can offer the type of support she needs at this point in time.

She actually reacted much better than expected and wished me good luck with everything. Which broke my heart a bit as, despite the difficulties, we did have some great times too. But I know deep down it was toxic- someone mentioned being an ‘emotional sponge’ which was super accurate lol. I am one. I do tend to put other’s feelings ahead of my own because I know how it feels to feel low and don’t want anyone else to feel that way.

Thank you all so much for all the advice and responses, I’m honestly blown away by how many I got. I’m trying so hard to get better at setting boundaries and sticking up for myself.. it’s hard due to my experiences growing up but today was a start at least. Thank you all again, I definitely feel like I’ve made the right decision despite it being a hard one.

UPDATE: Thank you all for your helpful comments and those who shared personal stories as well! He was super upset leaving his mom this morning which broke my heart. But after lots of hugs he slowly started to come out of his shell. Those of you who were nervous I would make a big production - I would never! Only wanted to implement activities that might resonate with him and help him feel more at home. So we did some coloring sheets of “Pysanky” (Ukrainian Easter eggs - thank u for those who suggested that! He loved it.) and a few older ones were able to say welcome in his language. I printed off how to say “drawing”, “water”, “bathroom” and some more which really helped. When he was upset I tried to pronounce drawing in Ukrainian.. and he laughed at me. I failed French in highschool so his laugh was warranted. 

The other kids were desperate to try and speak to him so a few started to say “hola” or “sensai” … apparently they thought he could speak Spanish and Japanese as well😂 but i’m teaching them how to say “hello”! Kids are so amazing. The second the kids went out for outdoor time, they were all running around laughing together, as if they had known each other for years. Language is no barrier when creating childhood friendships❤️ 

So thanks again!! And if you have anymore activities or advice for me, I would love to hear it.","[Original post for context](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/yo4mv1/good_friend_33m_of_11_years_goes_no_contact_after/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)

Don't get too excited, no further contact has or (likely ever) will be made between Eric and I, but I wanted to update everyone.

**UPDATE:** Thank you to everyone who took the time to write thoughtful, kind, and compassionate responses. I did not take the decision to have the conversation with Eric and Amy lightly and knew it could lead to the end of the friendship. However, not having the conversation would have ultimately ended the friendship as well. After much reflection on the history of the friendship and after reading the many considerate posts, I have come to recognize that these are not people I want in my life anyways. Thank you for helping me have this realization.

In terms of the friend group, as many of you suggested, I did update them. I kept it to the facts and did it in person to avoid miscommunication. They are all just as upset with they way Eric and Amy handled the situation, and support my partner and I 100%. As it turns out, the rest of the group was also uninvited from the party (with no explanation), so it seems Eric has made the choice to distance himself further from the entire group. Everyone is not surprised by this and saw this coming.

Lastly, to the people that reminded me I did the right thing by standing up for myself and calling out problematic behavior - from the bottom of my heart, thank you.

Y’all, sexual harassment is sexual harassment. Never feel bad about calling that shit out.

*edited 11.09.22 to add:* I will keep the line open for Eric should he ever need help, but for now I will respect the no-contact he initiated and not reach out to him. Since he has not blocked all of the friend group I will ask one of them to check in on him and keep their eye out for anything. 

**TL;DR -**  Thanks to the responses and reflection I have realized these are not people I want in my life anyways. Updated friend group, they are supportive of me, and also frustrated with Eric. Never feel bad calling out sexual harassment.",True

Edit: thank you to everyone who has been giving positive advice in the comments I really appreciate it ❤️","Me (f20) and my boyfriend (m20) have been together for almost 8 months now. I moved out my house because I started college this year and I'm living alone meanwhile my boyfriend is staying at a dorm. Usually my boyfriend would come over occasionally and leave to go to his dorm because he has to spend the night
there but for the past three months he has been getting permission from the dorm so he can stay with me. At first I thought it was just for a week but then weeks became months and now he has been living with me for almost 3 months in my house. Even though I really enjoy spending time with him I realize that for the past three months it has been extremely hard for me to focus on my studies and I keep beating up myself for
not being productive enough which is causing me constant stress. I also have to mention that I live very close to a relative of mine . It also puts extra pressure on me cause I'm constantly stressed since my relative can come to visit me any time while my boyfriend is at home. Last week I went to my hometown to visit my family so did my boyfriend. Since then for almost a
week I have been living alone and I realized that it is way more productive and comfortable for me to live by myself rather than living with my boyfriend even though I really love him. He mentions that he's gonna come back living with me after our exam which is in a week but I don't know how to tell him not to come because of the reasons I've mentioned above. I will also start my
German course in a week as well which will require me to spend way more time than I already am on my studies. Long story short would I be the asshole if I told my boyfriend that I'm more comfortable living alone than living with him and how should I tell  him so?

EDIT: His dorm is going to close next month but our school finishes on july. Thus that’s  another reason I’m hesitating to tell him to not stay with me because I feel like it would be cruel and selfish of me to make him deal with it. 

UPDATE: I talked to him about this and even though he got sad he agreed to only come over on weekends but it also has been hard for me since I’ve realized being alone makes me feel really depressed now because I’m used to him being with me 24/7. I find myself crying every night since he has not been living with me which is hard :(

They're just regular rocks you'd find outside, a bit shiny I guess and the shells are from different species of pond snails I think. What does this mean??? Why does he keep doing this???","Edit: Please do not share this to other subreddits, videos etc. I would prefer to just keep the discussion on this forum

My fiance (m29) and I (f25) have been together 5 years now. We are a multiracial couple - him being mixed as well as myself. I have known from the beginning that I was not the typical type of girl he dates - all his exes were the same race and build/look - I am the complete opposite. I won't lie, it did bother me at the time as I was struggling with an eating disorder in those college years. I eventually got help and overcame my illness and have been actively working on my self-esteem and body dysmorphia - I am now proudly 6 years free of my ED. He did help me get through that tough time.

Now to the issue - we were sleeping in the other morning when he decided he wanted some morning action. I was half asleep so suggested a lazy, cuddling while spooning session (his favorite). We started at it when he needed to go to the bathroom. Now, I am not a delusional prude - I know men are visual beings, I know he watches p\*\*n - I'm not stupid and I don't care. My only expectation is that viewing is kept discreet and private - the less I know about the details the better. P\*\*n is not something I partake in anymore myself as part of my recovery from my ED. I'm just personally mindful of what I consume but I do not expect the same from others. Do not misjudge me - I am not against the viewing of p\*\*n, I don't think it makes you a bad person - sex is natural, he can do that, just keep it separate. So.. He came back to the bed more excited than when he left so I put 2 and 2 together.

I didn't mind, I'm excited too so we continue on with our session. At the end once he finishes, I turn around to kiss him and his face is just glued to his phone. I ask him if he's been on it this whole time and he gets a shock that I was facing him and drops the phone. I pick it up and open it and hes on some NSFW subreddit - he was having sex with me while looking at other women. In that moment the level of shame and disgust I felt was overwhelming - it really took me back to those dark days in college and my ED. Those days when I was always comparing myself to others.

He's been silent since then - I won't let him touch me - even to hug. I feel so gross - like a toy, nothing better than a fleshlight. I didn't know he was on his phone while we were doing it. I feel used. And all the women he was watching while he was in me were all his ""type"". It kinda breaks my heart. Im mostly upset at the looking at p\*\*n while we're making love - but I won't lie that I'm also upset at the realization, that I will never measure up or look even remotely similar to these women he would rather look at. I'm tryna go through all my Cognitive Behavioural Therapy stuff - the processes - assure myself but I can't seem to stem the hurt. Am I overreacting? I don't know how to make the pain stop.

TLDR: My fiance got caught looking at other women while having sexy time with me and Im really upset and dont know what to do about it - im shocked honestly

EDIT 2: Okaayyy this blew up more than I expected - thanks to everyone who took the time to read and comment. I appreciate all the thoughts, advice, prayers, love and anger felt on my behalf. There's so much going on right now I can't write about everything

First off, I had the discussion with him. He was too scared to bring it up and apologize and admitted to being a coward and admitted to a porn addiction And then I got pretty pissed off and it all just came out... it went from disappointment to disgust to anger to disgust again and now indifference.

Anyways, cut a long story short - I've called off the marriage - he's seeking help independently and I'm focusing on my business because it's Christmas and Im busy and I got paying customers to care for. 

Also my grandma is over for the holidays so I will be spending my time with my family and focusing on my work. Im taking it one step at a time but I gotta focus on myself right now and enjoy the better things in my life this December. 

I can handle the rest after my much needed Christmas holiday.",True
140,140,"It's been few weeks that it's happening. My chronic migraine is worse than ever these last months. I simply can't function at all when it happends. My husband is very understanding, he takes care of the house and diner during the night when my migraine gets at its worse.

He always make sure I am ok, gives me my meds, food even though i always feel nauseous and can't eat he insists, he take good care of me.
However, at night he just decides that its the right time to have sex with me. Sunday night i was again awakened by him being on top of me, I though ""enough is enough"" and despite being so sick I resisted and said no and that its actually making my migrane worse, he said ""it won't be long"" and proceeded.
The day after I told him that I did not want to have sex during migranes, that I can't even move nor speak because its so bad. He said ""oh I thought you didnt mind it"" "" you will never enjoy sex anyway because you told me you are asexual"" and laughed it off.

It happened again last night. I know that whenever we have sex its all him doing stuff because i already told him that i don't like sex, but what he has been doing just seem wrong to me. I don't want to get physical with him and forcefully push him away, i can't even do that i am exhausted so i just let it happen... I don't know what to think anymore.

Update :
After reading all your comments this morning I just cried. I always refused to believe that this was rape and thats its all big misunderstanding. Maybe it's because I have such poor self esteem and confidence that I think this is still an ""ok but annoying"" situation ? I only said ""no"" one time during his actions, and the other time I didnt say anything and complained the day after or I wouldn't communicate my feelings at all all of the other times. I feel like he isn't vile or planning a mischief and at the same time I want to change this situation. 

I am going to take a break and spend the next week at my parents house. I'll take my courage and tell him to think of his actions and that was he is doing is wrong.I know my mom wouldn't think of divorce as a solution, she would say to talk to him again. I really need to build my confidence up and come back and in the mean time I really hope he understands that he was wrong this whole time.

Fyi: Our mariage was arranged, in our culture its the custom and some probably know that divorce isn't really the ""norm"", conflicts are usually solved through conversations. I am all new to this marriage life, its like the first conflict we have had. We have been married only recently june 2021. I still go to uni and he is working. We are living with his parents and it will take some more time to move out, I am not confortable enough to tell what is happening to my mother in law.","I (30|f) am the eldest of four (29|f), (16|m), (13|m). Yes, we are all from the same mom and dad. Both parents (51|f) (61|m) are immigrants from Mexico.

My sister and I grew up together as we were only one year apart. We were typical sisters although not super close. We were never those super close siblings that loved each other but we did play together and enjoyed our childhood very much.

When I was about 13 or 14 years old, my mom became pregnant with my little brother. My sister and I were SO excited! All of our cousins were the same age as us or a little older and so a baby was the most exciting thing for us!

When he was born, I immediately took on this motherly role. My mom never asked me to but I was so excited about my new baby brother, that I helped my mom with EVERYTHING! We're going out? I'll make sure the baby bag has everything in case of emergencies! Diapers? Check! Baby formula? Check! Extra clothes? Check! You get the point. After school, I was all over my baby brother! I have so many pictures of him and I together that I would post all over MySpace! When I finished my homework, my free time was spent on either MySpace and being a teen or my little brother.

When I was a senior in high school, my mom became pregnant with our second little brother. Another brother? I wasn't as excited but still excited. I graduated high school and moved about 30 minutes away to university. I didn't get to spend almost any time with my second little brother. I missed out on all his baby milestones. I was never there as I was living on campus. There's almost no pictures of me and him as a baby.

When I graduated university, I was living back at home. I only lived on campus for two years and the rest I spent commuting. When both of my little brothers started school, I was always there. The first pre-k drop off? I was there with my mom. Any school issues? I was there with my mom. Doctor appointments? I was there with my mom. I have ALWAYS been there with my mom. For EVERYTHING regarding my little brothers. I am basically their second mom. They have sometimes accidentally called me ""mom"".

But why were you at every single appointment? My mom doesn't speak English well so I've always been the translator. Always. I think this is pretty common for children of immigrants though.

So, this continued throughout my 20s. Second mom to my little brothers. Now, I forgot to mention, my second little brother, he's autistic. So MY MOM AND I, not my mom and dad, have gone through so much with him. My dad is always at work so my mom and I have been the ones raising my little brothers together.

Yes, I practically raised them both with my mom. This is the reason why I tied my tubes when I was 25 years old. I do not want kids. EVER.

I moved out in 2020. Man did I feel guilty about it. Horrible. I felt like I was abandoning my mother and little brothers. I'm a terrible daughter. How could I do this? Maybe I should have stayed like I always said. Stay until my parents are old and die. But, my boyfriend and I bought a house, moved in together, and got married. I cried for weeks because I felt like the worst daughter ever. Abandoning my little brothers and my parents.

I live 45 minutes away from my parents so my mom is constantly calling me. She has no friends. I'm her only friend. But I work every day. I work from home and my mom think I must have all the free-time in the world. I don't. She calls me every single day. A call can last 45 minutes and all she was calling about is about driving to Walmart because she needs garlic. She texts me all day every day. There hasn't been a single day since moving out that she doesn't text or call me. It has affected my marriage a little.

My husband and I want to watch a show? Nope. Have to pause it. My mom is calling. Or texting. I can see how much it annoys my husband and yes, it annoys me too.

Well, let's fast-forward to recent events:  
16 year old brother let us know a year ago that he was depressed and had thoughts of hurting himself. It has been a shit show of a year. Thank god we recently found medication that has helped his anxiety, depression, and thoughts of hurting himself. But this past year has been horrible for my mental health.

Anytime something horrible was happening with my little brother, my mom was calling me. You know, every day like she does. Man, it was bad. I can't even explain everything but it was bad. Feeling helpless as well because I live so far.

But he's better now. Thank goodness.

But I can't stand being the eldest daughter anymore. My mom calls me daily for help with anything. My little brothers do too. My mom calls me for ADVICE ON WHAT TO DO WITH HER CHILDREN like I am also their mother. I love my brothers to death. Like they were my own children, but I am getting to the point of losing my mind. I am there for EVERYTHING. Still. They've got a doctor appointment an hour away from where I live? I'm there. School issues? I'm there. I am still there.

Unfortunately, it's not just my parents. All my uncles and aunts always call me for help like I'm some kind of magically human being that can fix all their problems. This has been happening with them since I was like 10. So they've always seen me as the reliable niece who knows how to use a computer and knows English and knows how to do everything!

In the past month, my aunt (mom's little sister \[35|f\]) was involved in a domestic violence situation. She lives across the country and yet, I'm the one talking to her attorney. I'm the one typing up a 10 page letter for her attorney. I'm the one on the phone with her listening to her problems.

My dad's cousin who I had never met before moved to our state and is always calling me for help regarding his immigration status and filing paperwork for him and it's so weird. I don't know him. It's weird and he's expecting me to help him file for citizenship this weekend. I don't want to but I feel like I can't say no anymore.

This is an issue I have. I have no idea how to set boundaries. I'm an absolute mess and an idiot.

I'm sick of being everyone's problem solver. I'm sick of it. I know that even if I moved across the country, this would continue.

I'm afraid of setting boundaries with my mom because, I have little brothers that need me. What if I put my phone on silent and my little brother hurts himself? What if I put my phone on silent and my little brothers needed homework help?

I need help. And therapy. I need therapy.  


TL;DR - I am so tired of being a second mom to my little brothers and also being everyone in my family/extended family's problem solver.

✨ EDIT ✨: I texted my dad’s cousin and told him I couldn’t help him with his application and told him my other capable cousins could help him if he needed help. I can’t believe I did it!!",True
141,141,"I'll try to keep this short and to the point. My wife(39f) and I(43m) have been together 19 years, married for the last 10. For about the past year or so we've been fantasizing and talking about having a threesome. She's always been attracted to women so we always discussed another woman being involved with the two of us. Last weekend she went to hang out with a coworker she hangs with regularly. She got home after I went bed which is completely normal. The next day while I'm working she text me that stuff happened with her friend and her friend's husband. She promises there was no penetration of any kind (except fingers) by the husband but everything else you can think of took place. Neither of us has ever had a threesome prior to this and I'm pretty upset that her first experience was with another man! How concerned should I be here?

Edit: Never posted anything to reddit and definitely didn't think so many would respond. I feel I need to answer a few commonly asked questions real quick and give a quick update as to where we are.
Yes, we have 3 kids, 24, 15 and 8. 1 granddaughter and another on the way. We also have everything else you'd expect from building a life together, a mortgage, car payments, shared health insurance, etc.
Yes, this post is a real situation that I'm living 
No, I'm not a cuck
I truly appreciate everyone's feedback and advice, especially those that thought about all the variables that come with almost 2 decades together! This shit happened a little over a week ago and all we've done is talk and fuck. The talking gets heated on my end most the time. She has been extremely apologetic and the part of me that married my best friend wants to believe that this was a one time fuck up. She knows she fucked up...BAD! I'd like to hope if the roles were reversed, she would afford me some leniency. One comment addressed that couples that want to add others to the mix need clear cut rules, we didn't have those whatsoever. What she did is most certainly cheating! I know the majority that offered advice are gonna say I'm a simp or setting myself up to have this happen again, but I'm leaning towards taking that chance because we have so much more than time invested in each other. We love each other's family members and I can't imagine how many people would be devastated by our separation. I was 15 when my parents divorced, it fucked me up. Dropped out of school, got arrested a few times, did way more drugs than a 15 year old should even be able to get! I couldn't forgive myself if our kids spiraled downward because of this!","I'm renting my own flat after living in house shares and my mum is very nice and helpful but also the type to snoop through everything and move stuff around. She went to my place once to drop some furniture off for me and I left her the key while I was at work, thinking it was NBD, she would only be only there an hour max - big mistake.

I got back and she had been through every drawer moved everything around, including my bathroom drawers. She'd taken stuff like my razors and tampons out of a make up bag hidden at the back and put it all out on the shelves. She also went through a bag of clothes that I hadn't unpacked yet due to not having the furniture, and washed them all even though they were clean and had important stuff wrapped inside them. This caused me lots of issues including said important stuff going missing and video games going through the washing machine. Yes I've posted about that part before.

Anyway this was 6 weeks ago and since then I haven't let her there alone, she kept asking me for a spare key and I've kept saying no. She seemed to understand. However I visited her today with my brother and she's bought me a new TV cabinet which is lovely. My brother said he could drop it off for me as he was heading back and lives that way, and asked if I had a spare key. I said no.

My mum then said ""I've got one I had one cut that time I was at yours."" Which was 6 weeks ago and she's asked me for a spare key multiple times since then and I've said a firm No every time. 

I asked why she had it and she said it's ""in case I get locked out"". But she never mentioned it to me, pretended she didn't have one by repeatedly asking me for one, and keeps it at her house which is an hours drive away from mine at least in a different town. I've made her to give it me but I feel annoyed and violated and it's with an agency so getting locks changed isn't an option. She doesn't understand why this is annoying. She says there's no more 'keys' but that's not even the point really. Her intrusiveness is what is the problem. What on earth can I do?

She's 68 but always been like this since we were kids. And not just to me, she went through my bros ex girlfriends bag when she left it unattended, and she goes through people's drawers when at their houses.

TLDr: my mum went to my flat to drop some furniture for, went through everything and has just (6 weeks later) stated she had a key cut. I told her multiple times SINCE then I don't want her having a key.",True
142,142,"Edit: wow. I don’t know what to say, other than thank you. I had such a hard day today, and opening the app to see so much support helped me more than I’ll ever be able to express. I haven’t read through everything yet, but I will now. I love you all, thank you for helping me. 
————————

I don’t even know what to say. My husband died on Saturday and I can’t help myself right now but I want to try to help my dogs if I can. They keep looking for him, and checking the windows to see if he’s come home. I can’t say his name without them panicking and running to the door. It’s breaking my already shattered heart. 

Does anyone have advice on how I can help them to be less scared or upset? I think helping them with help me find some peace too. I don’t know how anyone survives this. He was my best friend. 

Thank you.","I've (27F) been with my partner (27M) for 3 years, living together and sharing a dog. Our relationship was great and the best I've ever had. We rarely fought but when we did, we communicated. 

A few months ago we got into a fight during his exam week and he decided it best that he temporarily stays with his parents. Unfortunately, he caught Covid-19 while staying there. His bedridden grandmother, whose house was beside theirs, caught the virus too and passed away after a few weeks. 

He came back home to me as a different person after a month. In his grief, he started pushing everyone away including me. During his anger stage, he was partly blaming me for her death. He started bringing up all our differences which we did not consider issues before. He said that he was only forcing himself to stay childfree for me, and because of this, he is no longer sure whether we should still stay together. 

I thought this was all an effect of grief and requested that he doesn't make any major life decisions until he feels better. We agreed to revisit this issue after a few months and in the meantime, we'll break up our engagement but still stay as a couple. I didn't want to be engaged to someone who isn't sure about us and I am aware that the issue of whether to have kids or not could be a dealbreaker. 

It's been two very painful months and he is starting to heal. I can still feel some emotional distance between us but he no longer actively shuts me out. I know this is great, but I can't help but still feel lost. 

In my early 20s, I decided to be childfree but really didn't think much of it again until the ""talk"". I am still taking my time to think about it deeper, and mentioned that my partner does too since his reaction might have only been because of his grief. I am not sure if he is really trying to think about it since it seems like he is already firm with the idea of having kids. I'm not sure if I should give it more time, though. 

Now, my issue is I feel like our relationship is stuck in a limbo while everything else in our lives moves. It's impossible to make any long-term plans when I don't know if we'll still be together in the future. For instance, I am trying to get a job that would require me to move to a different city and I don't know whether I should plan to move with him or not. He also doesn't know. Due to our engagement breakup, I also had to rethink all my future plans. 

I know it's only been two months, but I am emotionally exhausted. I am still grieving a failed engagement with no clear way of how to move forward...

TL;DR: Grieving BF changed mind about not having children, now the relationship is stuck in a limbo.",True
143,143,"I (17M) am thinking of buying pads for period, for emergency. now, I do not have a girlfriend or any reason to buy them other for just in case randomly I hear that a girl needs one and and can't find one, so I'll have like 2 in my bag at all times for the sake of having them, cause I know most girls have them and i think it would be nice for some guys out there to have them.
Would it be weird? Am I thinking right? Should I buy them?
For the record if I get them I'll get like a very general fit cause everyone is different as you know.
TL;DR: I (17M) thinking of buying pads for period in case of an emergency and I don't know if it'll be weird.

Edit: Thank you all for the responses and the kind words, I've baught them and when I get home I'll put 2 in my bag :)
Edit 2: For those of you who wonder what the situation would be like: (overheating a girl she needs one an has asked her fellow women and none of them happened to have one), me going quitely to the girl and telling her respectfully and again quitely that i have one if she wants and she is more than welcome to decline my offer if she's not comfortable with it.
And for those who think it's coming from a thirsty mind, it's not. How would I even go from giving them a pad to coming on to her?!","I just spoke to his brother's gf on the phone for nearly 2 hours. She immediately knew what I wanted to talk about because my boyfriend went to them(2 brothers and their gfs) and told them about this. She assured me she will be completely truthful and honest about what she knows and I can confirm any details with everyone else on the vacation because she would want someone to do the same for her. She confirmed that they were broken up for a while before the vacation and his ex actually bought the plane ticket herself. The ex still wanted to come even though his immediate family didn't really want that since they broke up. They fought the whole time and each of them clung to other people on the vacation. She assured me I have nothing to worry about that trip because it was extremely awkward and sour between them. Everyone knew he was seeing someone else at the time but was unsure how serious things were.  Apparently, when he brought me home for Thanksgiving, he told everyone that he wanted to tell me himself but just wasn't ready because he was too scared of the outcome. She did mention that she and some others have been urging him to tell me ever since as things between us got more serious. She said he really cares about me but what he did was stupid, I have every right to be mad and she'd be very upset as well. I guess he has been pretty fucked up the last few days and voiced his worries to them that I might end things.

I still don't understand why I had to find out myself. I haven't said anything to him since he confirmed it over text 3 days ago. I'm still very much in shock...he's the first guy I ever brought home. I plan to talk to him when I'm ready and more composed and it would take some time for me to make a decision afterwards. Right now half of my entire closet is still at his house, including some expensive jewelry.

\*\*\*Clarification: The instagram post was dated a year back. I just happened to see it a few days ago. The annual vacation is a big group of 20 people (aunts, uncles, cousins...etc, and their significant others). He was laying next to his ex, his brother's gf and his brother in the picture.

&#x200B;

In 2021, I moved to another state for school. My boyfriend and I met on a dating site in July and we hit it off instantly. He just got out of a 4-year relationship in February and mine (1.5 year) ended in March. My ex and I were still friends when we broke up, we even made plans for him to come visit me in September from another state. At the time, I wasn't really looking for a relationship and made it clear to him during our first couple dates. He knew about the visit and was aware I was talking to other dudes beside him. We clicked so well, we started hanging out almost every other day since the day we met and he slept over at my apartment after every date. We quickly developed feelings for each other and I found myself losing interest in everyone else. After about 2 weeks, he expressed wanting to be exclusive but didn't want to rush me and that he had stopped talking to other girls a while ago. He also started getting mad and hating the idea of me still talking to other people and having my ex visiting me in September. He told me about an upcoming annual family vacation that he goes on every year in August, it's a week-long and said he didn't want to lose me while he's away. He also jokingly asked if I wanted to come (it's all paid for by his grandpa) a few times leading up to the vacation. The night before the vacation, we cuddled in bed and poured our hearts out to each other. We had been unofficially exclusive for a month. I told him I canceled on my ex and that he wasn't coming in September anymore. He was so happy.

When he got back from vacation, he practically ""moved in"" with me. We lived together for 10 months and fell deeply in love. He said he's never met anyone he felt so strongly connected to. He asked me to come on this year's vacation with his family and I agreed. We talked about the future and made plans together. We drove up to his parents for Thanksgiving and Easter's in. I went to his relatives' parties and met his distant family, uncles, aunts, cousins...etc in for every holiday/occasion. He met my parents at my graduation in May. When my lease was over in June, I had planned to go back to my state and he would move back to his. He begged me to come live with him in but we ultimately agreed to do long-distance for a year, visiting each other every couple months and he'd move to my stateafter 1 year. After just a month apart, I flew to his state to surprise him for our 1 year anniversary. I ended up staying there for a month and went on vacation with his entire family in August.

I just got back home a few days ago and saw an insta post from his brother's gf of last year vacation and he's laying next to his ex-girlfriend in the Caribbean. I was in disbelief. I had no doubt in my mind that it must've been a re-upload from a couple of years ago but after asking him about it he admitted that he was stuck bringing her because his parents had already bought her the tickets and the trip was paid for. He said they fought the whole time and he wasn't even hanging out with her, he knew he had to tell me this eventually and it was what he was scared of the whole time. I burst into tears. I feel such immense betrayal, deceived, hurt. I'm reminiscing on the timeline and what we got going on between us then and just couldn't understand how he was able to keep this from me for this long, after everything. When was he gonna tell me? Was he ever gonna tell me at all? We were already so closely connected when he left for the vacation, we confessed feelings to each other, I canceled my ex's visit, he said ""I miss you"" when he was away...

I've been ignoring his calls and texts for a couple days now. I want to take some time to really process everything. I've cried so much and couldn't make up my mind if I should walk away or give him another chance. I fear that if I stay things would never be the same anymore, I'd be in constant doubt about everything. Just where and when do you begin to believe anything or trust him again? It sucks so bad because he's the first guy I've thought of as someone I could be married to. I feel like the future I've imagined just changed before my eyes. I'm an emotional mess right now and don't want my crass feelings to dictate the outcome of the decision I'm making. Please talk some sense into me.

TLDR: Boyfriend of 1 year went on vacation with his ex and his family last year while we were seriously seeing each other for 1 month at the time. I found out by accident through an instagram post 1 year later. He claimed they were still broken up and it was an unwanted situation (tickets and trip already paid for and not refundable).",True
144,144,"My (45f) 12 year old son has been getting into trouble at school. He is showing mild-moderate disrespect to teachers (talking back) and being disruptive by goofing around in class. This is his first year in middle school. Four of his seven teachers have reported this same behavior. 

He has a hard time dealing with disappointment, especially in sports. He has meltdowns and crying fits when something doesn’t go his way. He sometimes hits walls or throws things. These meltdowns can last a couple hours.

I want to take him to counselling because I am worried about him and I don’t know what to do. Everything I try ends in him getting angry and denying there is a problem. 

I got him into the therapist who was recommended to me by a colleague who has kids that see a different therapist at the same office. She described the therapist as being a “kinda cool guy” that works only with adolescents(she knows my son, too). I talked to the guy on the phone and he did seem like someone my son would be comfortable with. 

I told my son last night and he had a massive meltdown. He was devastated. He refused to eat and said he would go on a hunger strike and if I tried to take him he would run away. He says counseling is for “weak people” and this is going to ruin his childhood. He was a complete mess for hours. 

His dad thinks I should cancel. He doesn’t believe in counseling, but I do. 

I don’t want to make this worse than it is. I’m not sure what to do.","I'm also a hikikomori/agoraphobic/social recluse, which makes things harder.

She's staying with me and our parents with her two sons at the moment. [8M] and [4M].

She was with her husband [38M] for about 19 years, and they got married about 10 years ago.

No-one's told me the details on why she's leaving him, but she's told our parents. They understand these things more, I think, and would give way better advice than I could since I haven't had a girlfriend before.

All I know is that 'He did something silly' and that they've struggled in their marriage for the past few months.

Today I made pasta as dinner for me and her. I've also looked after her kids at points in the past two days!

I'm not sure if her kids have been told what's going on, but the oldest one isn't stupid and must know something isn't right.

I guess I am asking for general advice on how to help, but how I should react to things. I am sad because I have known him most of my life, and we regularly have spoken about computer games we've been playing. Does this mean I should remove him as a friend on PlayStation Network?

How should I help my sister in ways I probably haven't thought of?

Thanks a lot to anyone who read this!

**tl;dr** I'm autistic and want to know the things I can do to help my divorcing sister.

edit: I've also been talking to her about her interests and asking questions about them. People like that and she gets happy talking to me about them!

edit 2: I came back to see so many comments from so many people! I am so very happy with all of your answers! It makes me feel validated that people are saying I am doing well, but I am also so grateful for all of the amazing suggestions on how else to help! Thank you so much, everyone. :)

edit 3: I found out why they're divorcing. She caught him spending money on buying cocaine a few months ago, and that's why she was living with us for a bit in December. This time, she found him unconscious from doing cocaine when he was meant to be looking after their 4 year old, and left tablets on the side which he easily could have eaten. At the same time, he was meant to be picking up their oldest son from school, but didn't because he was unconscious.

**Update**: My sister is currently living in her house again, but I've been making sure to message her every day. Recently, she's gotten some anti-depressants, so I've been talking to her about my experiences using them. I've spoken to her about her interests and have suggested watching things together. We're going out to a restaurant next week and I've also offered my services to find shows/films that she might want to watch for when she next stays here. Since the parents are covering the serious side of things, I've ended up settling into the groove of being the person that messages her a lot about fun things and generally being a distraction. Just the other day, I made her cry from laughter with a very well timed 'That's what she said ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)' joke. I'm not neglecting to let her know I can be there for other things. Mainly the looking after children offer is the big one. I am there for if she needs it, and I let her know it's not an issue. Even if she wants someone to watch them just while she showers or something basic like that.

145,145,"My (33M) 12 year old daughter has been acting in a very strange way for a while now. A little background info, we live alone. Her mom left when she was 3 months old and we both haven't seen her since. So, about a week ago I came home from work and she was just sitting on the couch staring at me. Like always, I asked her how her day was but she didn't answer back. Then, I asked her if anything was wrong since she usually is very cheerful and happy when I come home from work. She just shook her head no and went up to her room. I went to the bathroom afterwards and saw the floor had soap or shampoo all over it, literally ALL over. I was obviously confused as to why that would happen, so I called her down to ask her. When I inquired about it, she smirked and mumbled something under her breath which i couldn't make out. I asked her in a firmer voice to explain what happened but this time she ignored me and walked up to her room. I was very puzzled but I told her she had to either clean it or I would ground her. She has never done anything like this before so I was perplexed.. Another incident happened this morning at breakfast. We were both in the kitchen, I was making pancakes as she requested, and she was pouring water. Oddly, she kept pouring water and didn't stop. I only realised when I heard water dripping. I told her to be careful, she was spilling water all over the floor, but she didn't react. I thought maybe she couldn't hear me so I said the same thing louder but she still didn't react. I had to come over and remove the glass from her hand. After that she just went to the yard and sat on the grass. I tried talking to her and asked her what was wrong but she burst into tears and ran into her room and locked the door. She refused to come out for hours and I didn't want to scare her in any way by forcing her to come out. About 2 hours ago she finally left her room and gave me a hug. I'm really confused, why is she acting like this? I dont want things to become worse so I felt it'd be best to stop whatever is wrong as early as possible. There aren't any school bullies or anything since she's homeschooled, and she sees friends everyday in the summer and she hasn't had any fights with any of them as far as I know. No online weirdos either since I always monitor her smartphone usage. I have no idea why she could be acting like this and it's really beginning to scare me.. Any ideas what can be wrong and how i can help her? 

P.S: Sorry for bad English, not my first language...


EDIT: Thank you all so much for your advice! I've made an appointment with a neurologist later today and I will be taking her to a therapist. I will be updating you guys on what happens.

A lot of people have been asking how her homeschooling works. She attends online school which is on zoom and has private tutors which come by our house 3 times a week to address any issues she may have. When she has tutors over, I never let them out of my sight (they sit at the counter and I sit opposite of them and just finish up paperwork) so her tutors aren't SAing her or anything. 
Also, I am not forcing her to be homeschooled, in fact, she refuses to attend in-person school. When she was 5 years old, I took her to school and it was her first day. At first, she was very excited to go but as soon as we arrived she started crying and refused to leave her car seat. I felt bad but I had to force her out of it as I had work and nowhere to leave her. When I came to pick her up I was informed she was STILL crying (7 hours). She was sitting in the corner just sobbing and from that day onwards I decided it would be best if she was homeschooled. It broke my heart seeing her like that. fast forward to when she turned 9 (4th grade), I recommended she go back to in-person school but she aggressively denied my suggestion. I obviously am not going to force my daughter to do something she doesn't feel comfortable doing since it's only going to make things worse. She has plenty of social interaction with friends and cousins her age. However, I'll check with her if she feels comfortable going back to in-person school now.


UPDATE: I took my daughter to a neurologist who thankfully assured us that nothing is wrong with her physiologically (no absence seizures, epilepsy, etc) but recommended I take her to a psychiatrist when I told him about what has been happening recently. Her psychiatrist appointment is tomorrow morning and I'm really looking forward to finding the root cause of her recent concerning behaviour. 
I asked her if she feels comfortable going back to in-person school and said she'd think about it which made me really happy since before, whenever I'd mention in-person school, she would get very defensive and upset. I also made it known to her that I'm always here for her if she ever wants to talk about anything, and that I'd never judge her or criticise her. She told me she knows that and that she loves me.
She seems to be looking forward to going to the psychiatrist (she wasn't too happy about the neurologist but I assured her it was for her own wellbeing). God, I feel incredibly relieved that she doesn't have seizures. Thank you all so much for the support. Will update after the psychiatrist visit.


Psychiatrist update: Sooo as it turns out, my daughter started her first period. When we got to the psychiatrists office my daughter requested I wait outside after we finish talking about what happened because she wanted to tell the psychiatrist something. I'm glad she did. Basically the psychiatrist told me everything, the soap was because she was dripping blood everywhere when she was freaking out about the blood. She knew a little about periods but freaked out because for some reason the blood was brown. My poor baby said she stayed up for days worrying about how I'd feel once she passes away (god forbid) and the water incident happened because she felt something ""drop"" down there which I assume is more blood. I feel bad about how I missed this and I wonder how she hid it so well. My sister is now in the other room talking to her about periods, how to deal with them, the feelings associated with menstruation, etc.. I'm incredibly glad it's nothing serious like seizures, epilepsy, etc. My daughter seems to be way happier now and I'm loving it. We (along her with aunt) went to get her a period starter kit after the appointment and she seemed really excited. After that we all went to get milkshakes and just chilled for a bit. Everything is great now. Thank you guys so much from the bottom of my heart for everything. ❤ 

Forgot to mention; she's decided to go back to in-person school which I'm over the moon about! :)","Hi all. I am 32F and he is 32M. Married for three years. I make the majority of our household income and pay the lion's share of our bills. He has a set amount we have agreed on to pay biweekly in line with his payday to contribute. We keep our finances completely separate except for this.

Before moving here, he had never had a credit card and his parents were in serious debt. I told him to be very careful with his card, but that it was a good idea to have one to build credit for himself, of which he previously had none. Over the years, he has abused that card horribly, even increasing his credit limit against my advice. I also had parents who were massively in credit card debt and know how that felt so I've never allowed myself to be and I like to think I manage my finances very well.

Several months back, of his own volition, my husband came to me distraught and seeking advice because he had overdrawn his $7,500 credit card. He told me to take his card from him and that he was going to remove it from online accounts to prevent usage until he could pay it back down again. I agreed and hid the card.

Fast forward to today. Every once in a while, I've checked in with him to ask how he's doing paying down his card, and he tells me he's doing well. I've been happy for him. Today I found a credit card statement left open on his desk and my curiosity took hold. He is still almost maxed out on this card. As of last month, he paid out more than he paid in.

His list of charges include a gift card for his PlayStation and several charges to restaurant takeout and food delivery apps. He has clearly not removed his card from any of these and has even made attempts to hide his food purchases from me when I've come home from work. He spent over $200 on fast food last month alone and this is the only month I've snooped on.

On one hand, with our finances separate, I feel like I have no business interfering in them like this, but it is affecting our lives too. He is unable to pay for basic necessities like paper towels, body wash, and groceries sometimes and I foot most of it instead. We need thousands of dollars in repairs to the house and he has already told me he won't be in any position to contribute so that will also entirely fall to me. This doesn't seem fair and I only found this out by snooping. Am I wrong to be infuriated? How do I approach this when we've already talked about his spending issues multiple times?

TL;DR Snooped on my husband's credit card statement, he is buying frivolous crap while claiming he can't afford to pay for household expenses. How to tackle this?",True
146,146,"I am a 15 y/o male and my dads is in his late 30s. Please forgive me for any grammar errors. 

Last night I came home later than curfew because the busses where late on construction my dad was upset and told me so, when I got home he was knocked out on the couch. I fell asleep shortly after. 

I woke up to him telling me to get up for school, I reminded him that I had to go to court and it started at 12:00pm my school starts at 9:00am meaning that I’d only be in school for three hours. My father is a busy guy he owns a business in which profits nose dive in the winter he is incredibly irritable when this happens. 

I told him that because of the timing of the court date that him picking me up at school 3 hours after getting there is a bad idea and “is inconvenient and a waste of time “ because again he is very busy and needs all the time he can get.

He told me “you’re going to tell me about bad ideas? You’re making me loose money because of your decisions” and he started to talk down to me.

He started to get incredibly mean and personal with his talking. 

This is where I’ll acknowledge my part in stuff I told him that he was being a dickhead and being mean to me because he was stressed. I shouldn’t have sworn and I’ll take that .

He got very close and started to yell in my face I started swearing more and he got very upset he pushed me and I swore at him and I think I pushed him back. I definitely did not strike or attempt to strike him.

He then grabbed me I tried to get away and told him to get off he kept on going I was not being very hard and he eventually got me on the ground.

He then placed his knee my throat and put my arm into the air he applied pressure to my throat I couldn’t breathe.

As I was laying there my mind was in shock, disappointment, sadness, and anger. 

I couldn’t breathe my throat hurt and I felt like I was going to pass out I kept trying to tell him to get off , that I couldn’t breathe,that he was hurting me. 

Eventually he let off I still couldn’t breathe for a second and started crying and coughing. After maybe 30 seconds I recovered and went to him in the kitchen with his wife (my stepmom). I was crying and screaming at my dad and his wife was talking to me I screamed “HE PUT HIS KNEE ON MY **** NECK”  she asked me how long it took for me to calm down , this had all taken place in a couple minutes. We all somehow ended up at the back of the house I was still crying and yelling when my dad started getting close and pushing again . 

This is where I’ll admit my second mistake I punched him in the face because I got scared. 
I was in the corner of the room and couldn’t get away.

He then punched me in the face maybe twice and punch me again somewhere else I don’t remember where We wrestled again and then ended up on the floor where he let me go again and I walked out of the house.

I walked around the neighborhood and And came back recording to get myself a outfit for the court. I have the video. 

I had recently moved in recently being in the last couple of months and I’m now at my mom’s house had time to gather myself and think and I’m disappointed and angry and I’m sad.

I do not want the police or CPS to be involved but I don’t know what to do I’m thinking about just not talking to him.","You can find the original post here: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/11kj06k/my_24f_bf_27m_doesnt_support_me_in_my_decission/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=android_app&utm_name=androidcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button

So, over the last few days I have been thinking a lot about this and I have had a serious talk with my boyfriend. By thinking I realized that I don't want the surgeries for myself, rather than to please strangers and having them to accept me. These are not good reasons for permanently alter your face. In addition, surgery scares the hell out of me. To sum up, I won't go under the knife. As soon as I can I will try to speak to a therapist about my self-steem issues. 

I feel a little sad, because it means that I will always have a weird face, and many people will judge me and reject me. But I don't want to lose myself and I don't want to risk loosing my boyfriend.

I then talked with him and made sure he knows that I understand why he reacted like he did and thanked him for helping me to see the truth. He was happy to know that I wasn't having surgery (He took my face in his hands and spent 5 solid minutes kissing my nose and my cheeks). He asked me not to do countouring on my nose nor getting my hair on my face with the purpose of hiding anything.

TLDR: I won't go under the knife, but I will see a therapist and I reconciled with my bf",True
147,147,So me 19 [m] I’ve had a pretty rough past months my lung collapsed and I have gained some weight being on Short term I was 118lbs. And now I’m 135 I’m 5’9 and don’t consider myself fat if anything I feel as if I’m at a more healthy weight but my gf doesn’t agree she’s been getting mad at me and I’ve started going to the gym however I can only do so much as I’m still recovering and have to take it slow in increments she told me drinking sugar doesn’t help and being on the elytmpatical for 40 min isn’t going to change anything and it just really has me hurt I didn’t respond at all to her when she said she’s not coming to my birthday dinner or seeing me this weekend I thought she might’ve of tried to call or apologize by now but she hasn’t and I don’t know what to do because Ik her and she won’t admit fault if I have to talk to her about it,"This happened two days ago and my boyfriend and I have been arguing about it since:

I work in homeless services, and lately one of my clients has been carrying his belongings in a garbage bag. I had this really nice northface back that I got a few years ago, but didn’t really use it. I wanted to give this backpack to my client so he could comfortably carry his things in. I was sharing this with my boyfriend and he was more concerned that I just gave away a really nice (and expensive) backpack when I could have sold it instead. I explained to him that I got it years ago, didn’t end up liking it after using for a while, and I also got it with a gift card so it’s not like I actually used my money. He thinks I just throw money away by giving away things I don’t want anymore.

For example (these are examples he gave), when he lost his AirPods, I gave him my old pair. These shirts that I thrifted 10 years ago, I gave them to him because they were more his style than mine anyway. He just thinks I just throw away money. 

I also like really nice things like jewelry, purses, and nice clothes. I don’t really spend a lot of money all the time, but sometimes I like to spoil myself every now and then with the money I earned for all the hard work I do at work. His biggest concern is that I (we both do, but I have more in student debt) and we both pay off our student loans and then when they are paid off, we can spend money on whatever I want. That sounds really nice, but I’m probably going to be paying off my loans for the next 30-40 years, maybe 50, or until I’m off this earth, regardless, I don’t want to stress myself out, and literally just be working to pay them off. I’m on top of my loans, and my bills every month, and still have money left over. I don’t always spend it, but again, if I see something I like and it’s not going to put me in a financial bind, I might get it. 

He would rather spend money on experiences, rather than materialistic things, and he thinks I’m being materialistic when I don’t believe I am. 

This whole argument has made me feel like I did the wrong thing and questioning if I am in the wrong about everything and am hoping to hear others perspective.

TLDR: my boyfriend won’t get off my back about how I spend my money.",True
148,148,"This is a long story but I will try and keep it as short as possible.

My husband and I have been together 10 years. A very happy marriage. Recently he told me he had constant thoughts about wanting to have sex with his coworker who (according to him) has a boyfriend of 6 years. And he asked me if I could give him permission to have sex with her. This was very hard for me to hear because am not ok with him having sex with another woman but also because he was about to go on a business trip with her. Just the 2 of them. On the 1st day of his trip they did alot of things together (which is fine) but come to find out, he invited her into his room to watch a show together. When he got home we had many arguments about this and I asked why he was so sure he could ask her to have sex without her being livid or getting fired, to which he replied because he believes the feeling is mutual and that there is sexual tenssion on her side as well. Again, lots of fighting, but in the end he agreed to boundries with this person, mostly not bring in a hotel room together.Fast forward a couple weeks, he had another trip with this woman. When he gets there, his room was canceled. I called him when he was at dinner with this girl and asked if he found a room to which he said no he hadn't found a room and he didn't know what he was going to do. Come to find out that was a lie that I caught him in. He did sleep in the same room as this woman but claimed that he had a cot that he slept on. Now, he is telling me he doesn't want boundaries with her. Only that he won't ever cheat on me..so anything else should be ok. I feel this isn't ok.  I guess I am wondering if I am being unreasonable. If he doesn't cheat, does that mean that this should be ok?

&#x200B;

lets say, for arguments sake, that I believe he hasn't cheated and that I believe him when he says he never will.... am I crazy for thinking that there should still be boundries here. Even IF he hasn't cheated on me with her? This is where  he is making me feel like I am crazy for asking for boundries.

**Update**  in case my update didn't show below...I took the woman out for lunch because at the time my husband said it would help me to see that she is a ""good person"" and that there was nothing going on between them. So I took her to lunch and paid for it and apologized to her. She acted like she had no idea. (She did I later found out). My husband admitted to kissing her and holding her hand back to the hotel. He says that's all that happened. That after the kiss he immidiatly regretted it. He says that absolutely nothing happened on that next trip where he slept in her hotel room for a night because his room wasn't booked for that particular night. So she came to his rescue 🙄 I called her and she Denys everything. Says nothing ever happened between them. Not sure why my husband would lie about cheating.","So my(29F) mother(51F) has recently started dating someone for the first time in, I think, 10 years. He’s(54M) a really nice dude and it started out as a friendship/roommate situation. But ever since they started dating I feel like my mom would rather not have my kids(1F, 3M) and I in her house. 

My mom has some hoarding tendencies and this guy has helped her get rid of some stuff and start organizing things. Which is great, she really needed that push. But it seems like she tries to get us out of the house quickly whereas I used to spend entire days there while my boyfriend worked. 

For example, I live in a town over and my boyfriend had a concert in the town she is in. He needed me to drop him at the concert and then pick him up when it was over because he planned on drinking. 

I asked my mom if we could hang out until the concert was over and she said yes. When I got there we were fine, just chilling, my other sister (childless) lives in her garage so she came in and we talked and played with the kids. When my mom came inside she said we should go to the park, at 7pm. I was like, no I don’t want to do that. 

Then she said let’s get something to eat and we did (because I’m easily bribed with food). We ended up having a fun time but how she was so insistent about us leaving was out of the norm. 

Children are messy, and I get that, but my mother has never been nit-picky about that stuff because her mother was so strict about a clean home. I feel like, since she’s been dating this guy, she doesn’t want to risk the kids making a mess. She has also said “my door is always open, I’m the kind of grandma who always has her grandkids, I want to see them as much as possible”. Now I feel like I can’t just show up whenever. I can’t just let my kids be kids and if they want to spend the night she always has an excuse. 

I kind of get sassy when it comes to my kids and my mom. So what I’m asking is, what’s a gentle way to approach this? Do I approach it at all? They still have separate bedrooms so I would trust my kids staying the night. 

Other relevant info: my mom has an in home adult foster care. She is working on getting a new client and uses this as an excuse why the kids can’t stay over. But it’s been going on a month now and it’s never been an issue before. Mainly because her space is upstairs and the clients stay downstairs.

TL:DR- my mom has a new boyfriend and I feel like she wants to keep her house clean by keeping the grandkids out

(I am not sure how long they’ve actually been dating)

**UPDATE/EDIT** 
I appreciate all the feedback! I’m using bits and pieces of all the advice and I’m planning on talking with my mom. 

I’m gonna start it off like “So you have a new boyfriend and I’m so happy for you! How’s it going? I did notice that your preferences have started to change. Are there any boundaries you want to set with this?” And “I’m okay with you setting boundaries because you’ve spent your whole life raising kids, I just need to know how to plan time to hang out with you, the kids and I miss you” 

-I know I came off as entitled and this is how I was acting. I realize that my mother deserves this time and relationship and it’s healthy for her to set boundaries. I want her to be happy. I felt like this new guy should get used to how WE do things. But the truth is I need to get used to how THEY do things. I am chatting with her tomorrow evening (without kids).


UPDATE: I talked to my mom and laid it out nicely to her. She explained that her biggest thing is getting organized and then of course she wants the kids over again. I told her to take her time. We also talked about her new relationship and that I knew it would happen someday, I just need time to adjust. She said they are just seeing how it goes and she’s adjusting as well. 

We talked for a while and she gave me details about the relationship and her getting ready for a new client, etc. I told her I would ask in advance when I can come over and she said that would be great. She said maybe we should even have monthly mother daughter dates so we can spend quality time together without the kids. 

I actually started out the conversation with the fact that I posted about her on Reddit thinking everyone would be sympathetic to me. But what actually happened was that I got a big slap in the face with a reality check. She laughed and laughed because she knows it’s hard for me to admit to her when I’m wrong sometimes. 

I just want to thank everyone for their great (sometimes blunt) advice! Lots of people told me very gently and lots of people told me harshly. I am so grateful for both because I am able to see my mother in a new light!",True
149,149,"We've been dating 4 months, for the most part things are going fine. He can be a little controlling but nothing to crazy. On Monday nights he picks me up from work drives me home and we hang out until he has to go to work at 3 am that night. Last night at around 2 am I woke up to being fucked. I was so confused but I thought maybe I was awake when we started but fell asleep halfway through from exhaustion, only to wake up later. But I asked him. And he said he started when I was asleep. I asked him to please never do that again, and he said he wouldn't. But I feel so uncomfortable. I don't understand why he would want to fuck a limp body. I know this isn't normal and it wasn't right, but besides that this is my most successful relationship to date. I'm wondering if I should question this relationship.","My mum is physically and mentally disabled. She relies on a wheeled walker to get around but isn’t fully stable and has had falls in the past. She’s also schizophrenic with early stage dementia. Hence, she’s exceptionally vulnerable both physically and mentally. 

She moved into a new flat about 2 months ago and one of her upstairs neighbours, a male in his 40s, seems to be taking an unusual interest in her. 

I’ve met this guy (let’s call him Bob for ease) a few times and he always seems overly interested in my mum. He gazes at her intently and when I’ve tried to talk to him, he largely ignores me and barely breaks eye contact with her. He stops her every time we happen to see him when we’re going out, and seems caught on every word she says, even when it’s nonsensical word salad (due to schizophrenia). He’s taken in and delivered parcels to her when everyone else just leaves neighbours’ stuff on a chair in the communal entrance. He goes out of his way to be nice to her, it’s almost like he has a crush but no rational man in his 40s is going to be attracted to an exceptionally vulnerable 70 yo woman with complex physical and mental care needs. 

Now, I’m autistic so I initially put it down to him possibly being on the spectrum, especially as the building was initially sheltered housing (it’s now an over 40s scheme) but I feel like even accounting for possible social difficulties, he’s a bit too friendly. 

Yesterday, I left my mother’s property around 4pm then returned around 90 minutes later to drop off a prescription, and I found her all flustered and irritable. She told me that Bob had rang her doorbell steaming drunk asking to be let in. He claimed he forgot his fob. Because the flats are so small and closely packed, you can hear when someone rings a neighbour’s bell. According to my mum, he didn’t try any one else’s bell, he went straight to hers. 

Now, he knows my mum is very physically disabled so it seemed strange he’d ring her bell. Her two other neighbours are in their 40s and physically fit so why not ring them? I feel like most people would try to avoid bothering an elderly disabled person. 

His reason also made no sense to me - apparently he’d forgot his fob, but had his individual door key? You’d keep them together since you’ll always need them as a pair to get in. I could see him forgetting both, but not one. Further, there’s 3 keysafes outside the flat with spare fobs for this exact scenario. Three safes to 4 flats makes it quite likely imo that he’d have the code to at least one of them. 

So he somehow forgot his fob but not his key, didn’t have access to any of the 3 key safes with spare fobs, and rather than call his immediate and much younger neighbours for assistance, he went straight to the most vulnerable person in the property??

Fast forward to 8am today and my mum informed me he’s left her a bunch of red carnations in the Christmas wreath she has hanging on the outside of her door. Not on the floor - in the wreath. We’re not sure when he did this but she didn’t hear anything last night or this morning so that makes me think he’s crept over in the middle of the night while she (and everyone else) has been asleep. No one has curtains on their flat doors because the glass is heavily frosted but you can still see shadows, lights, and silhouettes. It makes me uncomfortable that he approached her door in the middle of the night to place flowers in the wreath. Like I said he can’t really see anything but it just strikes me as odd. 

I feel like somethings wrong here and I’m not sure what to do about it. Can anyone advise on what might be going on, and what action, if any, I should take? I almost feel like he’s grooming her. 

I’ve spoke to my mum about this and explained his behaviour feels off but she got offended because she liked the flowers and thinks they were an apology for his drunkenness last night. 

I honestly can’t tell if this is just a potentially autistic individual who isn’t aware of the social etiquette of certain things, or if this is something more sinister. 

How do I approach this? Do I speak to him? Do I inform someone of my concerns (I don’t know his name or flat number)? 

My gut is telling me something’s wrong but I have no idea what to do. 

TL;DR mum’s neighbour is being overly friendly and left her carnations in the middle of the night. My mum is vulnerable and I’m concerned there’s  something sinister going on.

EDIT: sorry for the lack of responses guys - I am reading everyone’s comments. I’ve been busy calling various people about this so I am taking everything on board, just haven’t had a chance to reply. Will try to reply individually later.

150,150,"My daughter (18) had an ex bf who took nude photos and videos of her and stored it on his phone. They broke up a couple of months ago because of ex bf’s infidelity. She found out a couple of days ago through IG that her nude photos and videos were now circulating on an app and were being sold as a set. This app is notorious for being unmoderated due to freedom of speech but we still tried to report the channel as well as the person who’s selling it but we only got banned from the channel instead. She had already stopped crying but she won’t go out of her room and hardly ever eats. I understand her pain and when I found out about it, I was livid as well. We have an appointment with an investigator on Monday but I am at a loss on what to do. Some people from her school knows about it and have watched previews of it already so I offered if she wants to transfer schools, I could work it out so she could however she just stared at me and after a long pause said she’ll go back to her school since it’s only one more year until graduation. I don’t know what else to do at this point. Any advice will be helpful. Thank you.

Update: Thank you to everyone for your kind words, your encouragement and your advices. You have all helped. My daughter finally decided to switch schools and she’s in a purely online class now. She also decided not to go ahead with the case because instead of helping, the prosecutor intimidated her and left her feeling that she was at fault even though we have evidence that she was coerced so she just decided not to pursue the case anymore. Plus, she said she needed a change in environment so in her own words, “Instead of paying for attorney’s exorbitant fees” she’ll just go to a province and unwind for a year before she starts college. She is also in therapy right now which I hope would help. I realize it may take a long time for her to be okay but we’re taking it one day at a time. 

For those who commented regarding the title, I apologize. I posted this in the heat of the moment and I stupidly did not realize that it was sending a wrong message. I do however believe that my daughter is the victim here and that the words “involved in a scandal” was the wrong way to phrase it. For those who were triggered by it, my apologies.","My (24F) boyfriend (21M) is having a big sulk after I told him I didn’t want to have sex tonight. 

I came back home from working away for a week and a half. I’m very run down, ill and even debated him not coming around tonight as I just wanted to relax and chill out in front of the TV.

He tried it on with me and I told him I didn’t want to. He moaned and sulked and told me he hadn’t seen me in ages and he feels like we’re in an “old couple”. We’ve been together 8 months. I like him a lot but he’s not the most affectionate person, it always comes on all of a sudden during the evening when he wants to have sex. Otherwise he asks “matey” with me, bantering, teasing etc. whilst it is fun, I can’t help but it feels like we’re best mates so I’ve lost the sexual connection with him.

Anyway, I’m trying to work on getting it back but in the meantime I’m starting to dread having him around because of his sulking. Its not all the time, it’s not like I’m not sleeping with him. It’s just not every night.

His behaviour annoyed me tonight because I tried to explain to him that I wasn’t feeling up for it (unwell) but he wasn’t having any of it and just went stiff (we were cuddling) and went to bed without me, without even saying good night.

TLDR; boyfriend has big sulks when I don’t want to have sex. He’s not very affectionate until we go to bed at night then he puts it on me when he wants sex.",True
151,151,"I'm 17f and got pregnant(not by choice) when I was 13 years old. 3 weeks ago marks 4 years since I had the procedure done and my mom stupidly posted about it on Facebook despite me asking her to take the post down. We unfortunately live in a state that forbids abortion and a log of people left really horrible comments calling me a murderer and that if I'm that evil I deserved what happened.

I do not regret doing it(probably would have died given my small body size) and will never not advocate for easy access to abortion and said as such in the comments. Now I keep getting hateful messages both on social media and in real life and idk what to do to make it stop. It's really negatively affecting my mental health and I need advice","**UPDATE BELOW**

I don't like my dad. I answer his phone calls because he treats his body horrible and I know one day it'll be the last call. I wouldn't answer otherwise. I know it's bad, but it's just how I feel.

My parents divorced 15 years ago. He convinced me my entire life growing up that my mom was the reason for all of his problems and that she was an overall horrible person. I believed him and looked up to him a lot. I'm not sure how, but I finally started realizing he was full of crap. I really, really dislike him for how much he manipulated me when I was young. He knew that I admired him a ton, and he ate it up and absolutely used it to his advantage.

He still bashes my mom all the time, saying things like ""I haven't gotten sleep since your mom and I divorced,"" ""I was always in shape until after your mom left,"" and even telling me he has dreams about her where they're together- like a lot. It's extremely weird.

He's always been far too interested in my body, noting how I've ""developed"" and tons of other gross things. He's tried to teach me how to masturbate, forcing my hands to do the motion on my leg, and has touched me inappropriately several other times. He is not a good person. He's very clearly a pervert (he's very into women half his age or less), sexist, racist, and extremely close-minded. He's been single with a few girlfriends here and there. So he's been alone for a long time, and it's clear why.

I stopped staying with my dad at all when I turned 18. He threw constant fits about me not wanting to stay with him at his disgusting house, where I would have to clean up after him and use dish soap to wash my hair, etc. One day I told him he was just going to have to grow up and get over it, I live with my mom. I don't like carrying a million things back and forth, because I never had anything I needed at my dad's. He left me about 50 texts and 20 calls that day, all of which I ignored. This wasn't the first time he had done this.

He's been ""obsessed"" with me for a long time, treating me like his wife and making his problems my problems since I was very young. I've always felt like I've had to take care of him. Now that I've moved out and gotten married, it's hardly changed. He keeps track of how long it's been since we've seen each other. ""You know it's been two weeks since I've seen you, right? You know it's been 2 months since I've seen you, right?"" ""When you move back here will I see you more?"" It's also constant calls wanting to talk about nothing for hours. Like I've said, he treats me like I'm his girlfriend or wife.

He's also the biggest drama queen I've ever met. He treats his life like he lives in a movie. It's just the way he thinks and talks, it's very hard to explain but it makes him unbearable to be around.

I don't know what to do about him. I don't want to talk to him or be around him. My husband hates being around him. Everyone other than his family hates being around him. He had a heart attack last year, and that's why I've kept up any relationship at all. He doesn't treat himself any better to prevent another one, so it's hard to feel sympathetic. I just know he's due for another any time.

I went on vacation just last week, and a few days before, my dad called saying he's been thinking about going to the ER because he's been having chest pains and having trouble breathing. He has been having these problems since about June of last year, and he decided a few days before our vacation that he had known about for several months, to finally consider going to the doctor for it. He told me that he ""didn't want to worry me"" and he felt bad getting in the way of our vacation. In other words, he was expecting that if he went to the doctor that we would not go on our vacation and visit him instead. That we would cancel our non-refundable vacation that he's known about. He never ended up going, so the call was purely to be dramatic and worry me for the entirety of our vacation.

What brought on my post is that my dad is having some kind of procedure done to ""figure out why he has trouble breathing."" I can tell you exactly why. It's because he doesn't eat healthy, doesn't get regular exercise, and is an alcoholic. He's been telling doctors he doesn't drink or eat bad. He wants me there at this not-life-threatening procedure an hour away from where I live. Allegedly his much more adult sisters will be there too. He's making me be the primary person the doctor asks on what to do with him despite me saying I didn't want to be. I don't even think that's needed at his procedure. I'm tired of doing stuff just to please him and doing stuff so he wont throw a fit. I don't need to be at this procedure. I'm not his fucking wife. He's just got this creepy attachment to me that I hate. I just don't know what to do with him. I don't want to be around him ever.

tl;dr I don't want to have a relationship with my dad but he's not doing well health-wise- however it's all his own fault. There's also a non-threatening procedure that he feels I am obligated to go to, and I don't want to. What do I do?

&#x200B;

**UPDATE:** Thank you all so much for the comments. I can't believe this got so much attention. I can't reply to every comment but I've read them all. Seriously thank you for taking the time to offer me advice and kind words.

I guess I kind of never considered that what I've been through is sexual abuse or abuse at all. I know that's pretty messed up. I can see it pretty plainly now though that what I've been through is a lot worse than I thought. I was honestly really surprised to see people saying this was the worst thing they had ever read on Reddit. I wish I was making it all up. Wait until you know he used to be a youth pastor, too.

I think I'm going to send him a pretty brutal letter explaining what he's done to me and to never contact me again. Though honestly, he's really stupid. Like I honestly don't even know if he'll understand. He's the most oblivious person I've ever met. But that's what he's going to get. I know some recommend that I just ghost him, but if I do that I don't think he'll ever know what he's done and he'll continue to try to contact me somehow. I want him to know how much I can't stand him.

I'm also going to try my best to go to therapy. I know I've needed to go for a long, long, looong time. It's been the money really. I don't have insurance to cover it, but I think I'm just going to give in and do it. I have so much more to unload about this piece of crap. It's hard to even call him dad. I've also got more family issues, and an anxiety disorder! So yeah, I'm going to go to therapy.

Also I'm not going to his procedure. I told him I don't want to be his primary, too. Of course he said, ""Okay. But why, may I ask?"" Because I don't want to? I initially told him I probably wouldn't be able to make it because it was supposed to rain and freeze, and I didn't want to drive an hour in that. His reply was, ""I'll come get you the day before."" I'm telling you, he's oblivious. Then later he told me as if it was a demand that he wanted me there. So yeah, fuck that. I'm not going.

Anyways, again thank you all so much. I feel confident to finally do what I should've done a long time ago. Thank you thank you <3",True

She’s in school to be a nurse too, such a big heart. With winter approaching and it getting colder and her walking so far I figured the least I could do for her being there for me for so long and having my back and taking care of me at my lowest point is try and see if I’m able to get her a car nothing fancy at all considering her last car was a 1999 Honda Civic that she kept alive for God knows how long.

The other day I got confused by my maps app and missed several turns. We weren’t going anywhere important or somewhere where we had to be on time. It was a casual drive. He became very angry and slammed off my car radio. I was freaked out and started to cry. I told him I felt like he was angry with me. He said he was just turning off the music so I wouldn’t be distracted. I don’t think that’s true. He’s expressed to me before he becomes very frustrated and angry when I miss turns. I try not to but sometimes it just happens. I don’t know why it makes him so angry when it is an innocent mistake. I’m a responsible driver with years of experience. Also it is my car and my gas I pay for so the extra driving doesn’t impact his money in any way. It’s just extra time in the car. I felt scared by his reaction. Is this a red flag?

153,153,"TL;DR Discovered my husband has for a while been telling people I'm suicidal, and am generally mentally unstable. It's occured to me this could be part of an attempt to make it look like I commited suicide if I were to die suddenly. Am I being paranoid?

I (26f) Have recently found reason to suggest my husband (29M) could be plotting to kill me and make it look like a suicide.

Yes, I realise how out there that sound, let me explain-

My reason for thinking is is because I discovered he has been secretly telling people we know, for a while, that I am apparently suicidal, along with other things to make me seem mentally unstable, as far as lying about having to call the police because I was a missing person. Recently the thought came to my mind, that this could be a way of making my death appear like a suicide, if he were to kill me, and I wanna share those thoughts to see what others think 

It started after he one night told me not to go into the local store he works at, as he left early and had apparently used me as an excuse. Then not long after he happened to leave his messages open, and I noticed a conversation with his coworker about me, so curiosity got the better and I took a snoop. Turns out the excuse he'd used about me, was claiming that I'd gone missing and he needed to go look for me, adding the detail that I'm 'on suicide watch' even saying that he called the police. 
   
On another occasion, he said we can no longer go to his shop on Thursdays (It's the local store so we shop there regularly) because he'd told them he needed that day off as he takes me to therapy that day (This isn't true, we've never been to therapy)  

More recently we had similar incident, where he told me I couldn't go in the his shop as he'd used me as an excuse again. I Took another snoop and found he'd told them he needed to stay home with me due to my mental health. When he finally went back he told them that my brother is able to be with me now so he feels safe leaving me at home (I Haven't spoken to my brother in months)

To be clear, I have no history of mental health issues, never had to go to therapy, never been a missing person, nor has anyone ever had to call the police for me

This all also reminded me of a time a while ago, where he mentioned in casual conversation how he could get away with killing me, because no one would notice me missing. He explained how I don't talk to my friends or family regularly so they wouldn't realise I was gone, and he could just call my work and tell them I quit. This did creep me out at the time, but I brushed it off as a weird joke

For background, my husband is diagnosed with autism,  ADHD, and narcissistic personality disorder, he also has always had compulsive lying and anger issue. (I've Know of that since even before this) He also has a history of mistreating me, in a way some might call abusive. A lot of emotional abuse such as putting me down, both privately and in front of other,  being demanding and controling. He's never actually struck me physically, but has used threats of violence to get what he wants before

Although all this concerns me, I also feel kinda silly for being concerned. Maybe I'm just paranoid, maybe I actually am as crazy as he's making me out to be? An outside perspective would be helpful.

Should I do anything, or just ignore it and stop snooping?

EDIT: Apologies for the way I've been replying to comments so far, I realise I've been acting kinda stubborn and it isn't helpful. I'm Gonna pause reading the comments for a bit so I can come back with a more clear head. Please do continue commenting if you have anything though as I will read them]","I'm 25F.

I work with about 50 men, 20s-50s. Generally most of them are nice but they don't really speak to me much and I don't know how to bond with them/what to do. Mostly when we talk it's them saying they just got a raise/promotion/new car or something, and I don't know how to respond to stuff like that. 

They go out a lot together and I'm never invited anymore. I used to be, but since I've started a serious relationship those invitations have gone away. My SO has no issue with it, but I've heard from some of my co-workers THEY have an issue with it.

I know some of their girlfriends and wives have had issues with me working with ""their men."" Additionally, some friends I used to have at my work have distanced themselves from me since I've been in this relationship.

154,154,"UPDATE: I TOOK THE JOB!!!

Went to a job interview Friday 11/18, the company was thrilled to interview me, told me that my experience was exactly what they were looking for. Was offered 60k with 5% commission on any deal I close, so I’d making around 70-75k, and also told me that they could see me moving up to product development in a couple of years. Not sure how to proceed because my partner of 6 years relies on me for a ride to and from work, as he does not have a license or car. The new job is in the opposite direction of his workplace, and our work hours wouldn’t line up for me to continue driving him. If I take this position, he wouldn’t have a ride to work and threatened to quit his job or move out…sticking me with a $2200 rent. If I don’t take the job, I could jeopardize advancing my career. What should I do? I have until tomorrow to make a decision.","I (33F) have been with my husband (33M) for 13 years. Sex was never a priority for him but for me I have a high sex drive. Over the years we have discussed it and how it was difficult for me to be rejected on average 4 times a week and that unless I make a move we don't have sex. He has said that he wants sex but he just doesn't ""know"" how to start it and that ""all I care about is sex"" if I bring it up as an issue. We have been to relationship counselling and still going and she has given us activities such as he is to kiss me and give me a 30 second hug once a day and sexy messages but that's dropped off after a week. 

The past year I've just stopped wanting it because honestly I feel so degraded that I have to keep making the first move and that I shouldn't want it. 

We have only had sex about 5 times this year but a few days ago we had sex because once again I made a move. He said it was really good and wants more but I just feel so disgusted with myself and I hate that I did it. I started making a move last night and he told me he already masturbated that day and it just broke me. I climbed off him and just went to sleep feeling dirty.

I know he masturbates (I find the mess) so I know he has a sex drive but it's like I'm not worth it or something. 

We have had so many discussions and plans on how to fix it but it never works for more then a few days and I'm honestly just so hurt and fed up I just can't keep having the discussions any more because it's a waste of time.

He said he wants more sex but I just feel like maybe it's a mind game he is playing to keep me interested or like a power thing? 

I'm just not sure what to make of it because other then this our marriage is good but I need some insight.

155,155,"We’re both 19. The first time we had sex I thought was nice and then we did it again and I asked her if I was doing anything wrong and she told me she’s use to guys with 7-9 inch dicks

I felt hurt after this and measured my dick when it’s hard and I’m 6 inches. I thought this is normal?

Edit: everyone keeps commenting that she never said it was small but she did say it, just because I didn’t clarify it in this description but I mentioned it in the title so I thought I didn’t have to repeat myself but anyways after I measured it, her exact words were “that’s pretty small but I still love you”","
This is a throwaway account. So, for context: I've been with my partner for 3 years and 5 months now. We've lived together since 2020. I've known my best friend since childhood and I love her very much. We've always been very open with each other and when she was with her ex (for some reason) they'd talk a lot about their sex life with me and my partner, and this still went on even when they broke up (she'd bring up the topic to me and my partner every time her ex was mentioned, talking about how he didn't really satisfy her, even though he'd always say he was very good and so on...).

Last year I started to notice my partner was looking at my best friend a certain way, and was acting a bit off around her, so I confronted him by asking him if he liked her after I noticed this was frequent (about 2 to 3 months of this behavior). He was beating around the bush, so I got desperate and as he was just going to give him an answer I said: ""If you like her, I'm going to dump you."" As soon as I said that,(obviously) he denied it. We had a talk about 3 days after that where he asked me to forgive him for acting weird, and cried for me to give him a chance. So we're still together. I told my best friend about it because I just felt awkward around her for a bit, but after I took some time apart, I was able to hang out with her without issues.

Even though we've been together since, I've still had the feeling that my partner didn't give me all the information and that made me feel very anxious. I would ask him at least every now and then if he was honest to me that day because something still felt off to me, and he would always deny it and even went as far as to say: ""If you keep talking about this and don't move on, I will have to leave you,"" but we'd work through that.

 I usually didn't feel weird when they were around, but lately I noticed my best friend would make comments about her sex life when my boyfriend came around us even when it wasn't on topic. For example, we were talking about my mother's friend dying and when my boyfriend came to the kitchen to get something she quickly said, ""Anyway, my fwb says I'm very good when I'm on top of him,"" and I just find that very weird... 

Anyway, this and the fact that after that she acted weird made me feel bad and remember the topic. She decided to stay the night suddenly (I would not say no to her, but she didn't give me a concrete reason). So when she left the next day she was teary eyed and didn't say goodbye to my partner. Logically, this couldn't have anything to do with him, but I felt something was off, so I asked him again (Still don’t know why she was teary eyed, but I spent all night awake with my partner while he worked on his thesis so I know he didn’t do anything to her. But I still wanted reassurance.)

I asked him if he liked her, he said no. I asked if he did something to her, he said no, and he said that if I'm doubting him, I might as well doubt her as well. I told him I doubt both of them (taking into consideration what I wrote about the random sexual comments) and he said we’d talk that same night.

At night he said that since I revealed I didn’t trust her either, he’d be honest: Basically, since she’d always bring her sex life up, he started having sexual dreams about her frequently for about 2 months and started to like her and even considered breaking up with me to try having sex with her if he ever felt too attracted, but after I confronted him, he said he realized that the whole situation was a mistake and he didn’t want to be with anyone else sexually or romantically. He claims that after the confrontation he hasn’t felt anything towards her and that he realized he was just confused bc he heard too much about her sex life and got curious. After telling me all this, he begged me for a second chance and I said yes but I still feel betrayed, even though he didn’t do or try anything… but I’m confused wether this is to be considered cheating/red flag or not. One of my other best friends told me that it’s normal to feel attracted to someone else when in a relationship, but this hasn’t happened to me so I’m trying to understand.

I’m still trying to process things, and I don’t want to break up if it’s really normal, but I do feel betrayed bc he felt like that towards her and she’s my best friend. What should I do? Is this really normal?

EDIT: 

TLDR: Partner admitted to having wet dreams  about and liking my best friend for about 2 months last year. I feel betrayed even though he didn’t act on it, so I’d like to know if this is normal and should give the relationship a shot…

EDIT 2: 

Since this seems to be a very common comment, I want to make this clear: I’m reevaluating BOTH my relationship with my partner and my friendship with my best friend. I have taken the decision to give my partner a chance for now while I think things through and we talked about boundaries I have to apply with my best friend (if I decide to keep her in my life). 

I never defended my friend’s actions, but I haven’t confronted her about them yet because I just recently started to notice this behavior.

EDIT 3:

Since this also seems to be a very common comment, I also want to make this clear: I’m NOT mad at my partner for having the dreams. I’m hurt because I could clearly see he liked her and he denied it repeatedly until I disclosed to him I didn’t trust her and I just wanted to know if this was a common thing long time relationships go through.",True
156,156,"What would you do in this situation? I was woken up around 7AM this morning to my husband asking “did you bring someone here last night?” To which I replied “No. what are you talking about”. He said “We have a weird situation, there’s a stranger in the house.” 

So I was freaking out and jumped out of bed. I went in the living room and there was a women in our living room crying saying she didn’t know how she got here. Mind you, we have a 4 year old who sleeps in his own room. 

Apparently she had been here all night sleeping on our couch. So I’m freaking out and telling her I don’t care how you got here or why, but you need to leave, now. Well apparently my husband had offered her a cigarette and let her go on our deck to smoke. And then proceeded to tell me he was going to give her a ride somewhere. I was literally begging him not to. I told him it was dangerous and to please not. He said directly to me “I’m going to do it.” 

So I called our landlord who lives directly under us and asked him to check him cameras that he has outside to see when she might’ve broken in. He left work and rushed here. While we were waiting for him to get here, I left the room to get something and two seconds later my husband comes in the room. I’m like “wtf are you going? You can’t leave the baby alone with her in the other room.” Like where are your protective/ survival skills? 

When our landlord got here he approached her very assertively and was asking a bunch of questions and asked us if we wanted to call the cops. I said yes, despite knowing my husband did not want to. So the cops come and decide to take her to the hospital. It was definitely a mental health and/or drug situation. Which I can sympathize with, but ultimately she broke into our home and I am so shaken up I want to move immediately. 

I don’t even want to sleep here tonight. Anyways, my question is, am I over reacting by looking at him different from this situation? I feel like he was so nonchalant about the situation. It could’ve been way worse and his response as to offer her a cigarette and a ride. I’m just mind blown and not feeling safe at all. What are your thoughts? What would you do in this situation? 

EDIT TO ADD: I posted this in the heat of the moment and obviously I am not going to leave my husband because of this. I just wish he reacted in a more protective manner and asked her to leave rather than give her the opportunity to harm us. I’ve always appreciated his empathy towards people but I think the safety of his family should’ve came before a home intruder. Something like this has never happened to me. This is quite literally my biggest fear and he knows that.

Edit #2 to add: Wow. After reading someone of these comments I am shocked at the amount of people calling me a psycho and crazy because I was upset someone literally broke into my house. 

No where in my post did I say I was confrontational, angry, aggressive or even slightly violent. All I did was calmly ask her to leave my house immediately. I didn’t threaten to call the cops to have her arrested, nothing. I simply went into another room with my son and called my landlord and asked him to check the cameras to make sure no one else was in my house and to see what time this happened. I had zero intentions of having her arrested. 

My landlord and I agreed to call the police to get her help. We all agreed we weren’t even going to tell the police that she broke into my home. We told them she knocked on my door and asked for help. In no way did I want her to get in trouble. I wanted to get her help. I just wanted her out of my house and away from my kid like any REASONABLE person. 

I’m the type of person to give money to homeless people every-time I see them, donate clothes, volunteer and advocate for people who struggle with mental illness. As I said in my first edit, I obviously am not going to leave my husband after this. My frustration comes from the fact that I wanted her out of my house.

A lot has happened to say the least. The day I posted my last thread, after Ella was in her crib, I decided to confess my feelings to Alice. I wrote a whole thought out speech of what I was going to say and completely derailed about two sentences in into an incoherent rambling mess. Alice just stared at me. I thought I messed up right then and there.

Then she said, “Finally,” and she kissed me. My brain stopped and went all the way to Cloud9. We started making out, things got more heated, and we acted on our mutual feelings. 

Afterwards, I asked her about the guy she wanted to ask out. The conversation went like this:

“You’re the guy I wanted to ask out, dummy. Why do you think I asked YOU how YOU would want to be asked out?”

“Oh”

She started listing out all the hints she tried to give me over the past year, but my caveman brain ignored. We just laughed at my stupidity.

It’s been an amazing month and a half. In the following weeks, we tried to “get together” as much as we could, but stopped when she seemed to come down with the flu a couple days ago. She told me she’d get a COVID test. Thankfully it came back negative. But the pregnancy test came back positive.  ^_^

She cautiously asked me what I wanted to do with it. I told her that I would support her either way. I tried to contain my excitement because I didn’t want to bias her answer into keeping it. She said that she wanted to keep it. I hugged her and said that I would be with her every step of the way.

And yeah that’s really it.

157,157,,"Husband and I have been sleeping separately for several months. It helps him sleep and even though I suspected I would dislike it; I actually enjoy the privacy. 

I do, however, miss him from time to time. He would often ask me to play with his hair. He falls asleep pretty fast (but is also a light sleeper, hence sleeping separately) so it would take only a few minutes of playing with his hair for him to fall asleep soundly. I enjoyed that he would fall asleep feeling safe and loved.

Sometimes I wake up in the middle of the night and wish I could hug him. Other times, we would wake up independently in the middle of the night, make love and fall asleep in each other's arms. There are other little interactions, but you get the point: I miss the intimacy of sharing a bed.

Now, he leaves for his bed when he's feeling sleepy, but at that point I'm often half or an hour away from falling asleep myself and wish we would cuddle more. Sometimes we cuddle in his bed, but I leave before he falls asleep because waking up messes with his sleep a lot.

I feel like I'm being a bit clingy, but at the same time I very genuinely feel what I feel. I miss what we used to have but know some of those things really mess with his sleep. Intimacy outside the bedroom doesn't feel the same no matter how much I wish it would.

How to find a balance?

**tl;dr:** Husband needs to sleep separately to rest well. I'm more of a cuddle bug in bed, which is generally not great for his sleep quality. How to find a balance?",True
158,158,"My(17f) dad tried to strangle me when I was 13. Ever since then I've been very uncomfortable having anything around my neck. Earlier today I was sharpening a pocket knife in my room when all of a sudden I feel something around my throat and I can't breathe. I instinctively slashed at whoever was strangling me.

My moms bf starts yelling and I turn around still trying to catch my breath and see him with a bloody hand and a belt. He started yelling about calling the police but didn't since it would look bad on him. I'm fucking pissed off that he thought of doing that. He knows my trauma and still thought it'd be a funny joke.

My mom took my knife and yelled at me saying that I had no reason to think I was in danger and now I feel terrible. Idk what to think anymore","I've been friends with her (we'll call her S) for a few months, I met her through mutual friends at a getaway trip. Everyone else was dating or single and talking to eafh other. I hit it off with her since the 1st time I met her. 

Withing the 1st day of meeting S I hooked up with her and talked with her a lot. After coming back from that trip, I stayed in touch with her and i kept seeing her. I know she isn't ready to date yet. But I have enjoyed spending time with her going out or staying in with her.

Her friends know this and have tried telling me to find a ""better"" woman or have tried getting me to sleep with one of them, but I have declined. S has told me she is sometimes nervous to be naked around me now because of her friends, but I have told her she's just perfect for me and I enjoy having sex with her.

I dont mean to offend anyone,  but I personally prefer a thicker woman for myself. The sex is just better and more comfortable. We were all hanging out again recently and her friends said that I ""took one for the team"" and I told S to ignore them. They said someone like me should be with a much better looking woman (which isn't true) and I know that hurt S's feelings.

I told them off right then and there and tried reassuring S away from them. She's been more self conscious now and she doesn't want to take off her clothes during sex sometimes. I've tried telling her I like her exactly how she is and that I don't want her to change. 

I dont know what else I can do to bring her self esteem up? I compliment her everyday and I try really hard in bed to please her and show her I like her body how she is. Ive kissed her around her body a lot more and try to be physically closer to her now. 

Tldr: My best friend + FWB is self conscious and she thinks I am ""out of her league "" . I think she is perfect for me and I am trying to help her after her friends made bad jokes to her.",True
159,159,"My girlfriend and I had just went on a date and I got into a really bad argument that was so bad that we almost broke up. She blocked me and we had basically broken up.  After that she went to her place, that I usually stay at and I went to mine. I was planning to make it up to her in the morning.

&#x200B;

When she got back to her place she went out to a party with her female roommate and her male friend who I had seen earlier in the day at her place.  This was concerning because I had never seen him before her roommate was actually engaged. They met the rest of their friends at the party

&#x200B;

When they got back from the party her roommate told her that the male friend was going to sleep over because he was from out of the country, which I didn’t know because my gf and I weren’t talking at the time. 

&#x200B;

Her roommate asked my gf if her male friend could sleep in her room on the floor because apparently he was too tall to sleep on the couch. Before even asking her he had already put his stuff in her room. That pissed my gf off and she took his stuff out and said no. After that the male friend  came into her room after she told him to get out but he didn’t listen. She then went into the living room and then her roommates room but he kept following her around the apartment. She told both of them he couldn’t stay in her room and that she didn’t like him. She told me that she made it clear that she did not like him and that she was yelling at him and hitting him.

He came back into her room anyway. After that she was laying in the bed and he jumped on top her and raped her. He finished once and then tried to go another round. After that he left the room. She then locked the door. After that her roommate came to her door and begged her to let him back in so that he could sleep on the floor. IDK why in that moment she did not tell her roommate that he had just raped her. Anyway her roommate asked if he could sleep in there because her boyfriend  was at the front door and she didn't want him to see her male friend. For some reason my gf still let him back in because she did not want to make her roommate mad. After that she gave him a blanket and then he slept on the floor. I think it is weird that she watched tv and slept soundly after what had happened.

The next morning at  9am she emailed me said ""I'm about to unblock can you call me? My roommates male friend basically raped me last night and tried to do it again this morning."" Apparently the male friend woke her up at 8am to do a repeat of last night. She said no and ran into the basement of their apartment where she hid from him. He then left the apartment entirely.

As soon as I saw the email at 12pm I rushed over to her apartment. I asked her if she was okay and she said she was fine. I asked her why she didn't call the police and asked if she wanted me to call them. She said no. I then  told her,  ""Why would  you or me be okay with? We are going to let your roommate and the male friend get away with this? I leave for one night and gf gets raped?""

I started yelling about I wasn't going to let her roommate bring a predator into her apartment,  dismiss her call for help, and force him to stay in her room. My gf told me not to tell anyone and just to forget about it. I was so confused as to she saw the situation unfolding, but didn't call me, her bother, the police or scream at her roommate for letting this random guy bother her. When I got there she wanted me to keep quiet about it. 

Her roommate heard our conversation and asked what was going on. She  called the guy on FaceTime. The roommate and the male friend made it seem like it was friendly and that everything was okay. The roommate told me that it seemed like my gf and her male friend were flirting and playing around. My gf wasn't crying and didn't seem to be that angry, but overall wasn't as emotional as someone I expected to get raped. Also in her email she said, ""basically"" raped which was weird to me. Also when I got her place I saw semen on her shorts and two hickeys on her neck, which made me extremely angry, sad, betrayed, and so many emotions  wrapped together. IDK what to do about this. I believe my gf, but also her roommate and male friend were so calm about it and really made it seem like this wasn't a rape. This whole thing really broke my heart and it seems to be affecting me more than my gf. She told me to let it go and don't talk about, but how can possibly let this slide and chill at her place when I absolutely hate her roommate. I also hate how her roommate and my gf are handling the situation. I feel like I'm the only one who cares. Do you think my gf was cheating on me? What advice do you guys have? I really don't know what to think or do.","I've just this week moved into a flat and my mum has been helping a lot. She drove my furniture to the new flat and bought me a table and chairs. In grateful for this but she is a very nosey person and I've always had to hide any personal things for when she visits, as she looks through all my drawers and also moves stuff around all the time causing me to lose important things.

I was having a delivery that couldn't be rescheduled but I was at work, so she offered to wait for it in the flat. I made sure to hide my important stuff in a zipped up bag, wrapped in clothes in the wardrobe, covered by a duvet. Felt okay about it all as I took precautions, but stupidly underestimated her nosey-ness.

I had keys to my old flat that need to be handed in before the weekend, which were in a tiny pouch hidden in some jean pockets. My DS games and jewellery were locked in a small safe also in wardrobe, the key to which was hidden inside a sock in the inside pocket of a tiny suitcase under the bed. There was also a 3DS in the same suit case and feminine care items. I pushed it right to the back under the double bed so it was very hard to reach and put a cushion in front to hide it.

When I got back, she had 'done multiple clothes washes' which included all clothes in said bag, the sock in the suitcase, and literally everything in every drawer. Stuff id washed at hers and not even worn yet. This meant that my old flat keys, the key to my safe, and all the other stuff had been through the wash. Of course I couldn't find barely any of them. My 3DS, headphones, the keys, and other items are still missing.

Not only that, but I've had a gum infection and am on antibiotics which were in a drawer in the kitchen. She rearranged all my drawers and now I can't find them anywhere. I've found the painkillers I was taking to help with it in the cupboard in the bathroom. But they were both together in the kitchen.

I've been texting her asking where things are, and she gets mad each time and calls me ungrateful, saying she was trying to help. She can't remember where she moved anything. But this is a huge invasion of privacy. Also I'm in trouble now as I can't find the flat keys, cant get to a Dr to get more antibiotics, and I love my 3DS. 

How can I talk to her about this? She wants to come over again soon, but even when I'm there I can't let her out of my sight.

TL:Dr: my mum came to my flat and moved everything around, put stuff through the wash that was valuable. I don't know how to talk to her about it without her getting angry.",True
160,160," So me and this guy play college football together. My sis went to his place to hook up, and apparently he slammed her face into the bed and smacked her bum cheek repeatedly, leaving an awful bruise as she fought to escape before she yelled ""let me go"" and he did. She told me what happened and showed me the bruise. Now I'm furious. We don't go back to school and football until September, so I won't have to see him for a while. She graduated from college so won't be seeing him there. What do I do in the meantime?","Last night my sister was sobbing in her room.

After initially saying it was nothing, she said she thought I wasn't going to love her anymore after our sister is born (mom is 6 months pregnant) because I'm gonna love our sister more than I'll love her. And she was *crying* like ""it's over, you're never gonna love me again"". 

I tried to calm her down but it took a few minutes. I told her that no, nobody was gonna love her less just cuz we have a baby in the house. She seems to have kind of understood but told me to *not* tell our parents because they'll be mad at her, which is not true but I can imagine it would be distressing for her to think about them being aware of this.

For context, I was adopted when I was 10, then she was adopted when she was 6 and I was 15, almost 6 years later.

So, what do you do in this case? I would imagine telling them would be best but I guess I don't know how she'll react to that? How should I approach telling them knowing she doesn't want them to know?

161,161,"I have an old friend who I started snap chatting again in the past couple months, getting a streak going. Most of the time we’re just sending goofy pictures of our faces or whatever we’re doing, but today she sent a picture of herself just in her bra and underwear. I was surprised, but didn’t want to have the wrong impression so I just sent a usual goofy picture. Now that I’m thinking about it, I’m genuinely not sure if I missed something or if I’m overthinking this. Does it mean nothing or am I going to be thinking about this moment when I can’t fall asleep five years from now? For context, I’m 20 M and she’s 19.

Very grateful for all of it!","I'm a 37-year-old woman and I'm graduating from college with a Mathematics BS this month, I'm headed to grad school in the fall.

My younger brother (35) and I both dropped out of high school in our teens. I've decided to change my life, went back to school, fell in love with math and am leaving my program with a solid 4.0 honors diploma. I know my shit.

My brother has remained a dropout and has done nothing to improve his life. When he was a kid, he wanted to go into physics and because of that, my mom (61) decided somehow that his interest indicated vast knowledge in mathematics.

The past 4 years of my education, while I grow as a person and a student and find that I really know wtf I'm doing in math and I love it has been met with constant assurances from my mom that my brother knows more than I do in the field and I just, I cannot deal with it anymore.

I wish it didn't bother me, but it does. It's incredibly invalidating and I've just had enough. Every scholarship, award, honor, and opportunity that I've been offered has had to be about my loser brother in some way. I've tried talking to her about it but she just dismisses me and denies that's what's happening.

I love my mom, I do, but I'm tired of what I've done being diminished by her favoritism for him. My husband (42) thinks I should go NC with her, and I see the value in that, but he has his own issues with her that may be coloring that suggestion. I'm not really sure if I want to die on this hill and would really appreciate input from uninvolved third parties.

But this morning it kinda got weird.
 i received a call from her at 4am, i answered right away expecting the worst. Cause ya know, why else would your friends mom call you at that insane hour. 
She goes on to say that her son has been worried about me and she wanted to know if i was doing alright.
She then goes on to tell me about her life at work, home, and all of that jazz. But the longer she gets to talking the more suggestive the conversation got (on her end ofc) 
It became very obvious she was trying to have me come over and ""make each other feel good"" .

Should i address the situation to my friend?

Wow I didn't realize this blew up. I have not seen or spoken to her since I posted. Also for the people speculating how my age comes into play, I've been friends with her son since middle school. So she did know me as a child. Does that make her a predator? I have no clue. 
There has not been a real solution or ending to the story other than it never happened again and I never brought it up. 

Sorry to those of you who expected some kind of confrontation story but that never happened and never will lol","Hi Reddit. Recently I (18m) created a post about finding out my dad (43m) was attempting to cheat on my mom (44f) using tinder and other messaging apps as an excuse to practice his English speaking. A lot of people suggested I tell my mom so I told my dad if he doesn’t tell her himself I am going to tell her myself and I did. The day after when he came home he was sitting alone at the balcony so I took this opportunity to sit and talk with him. 

He told me whatever he does regarding his relationship with my mom is none of my business and he provides us everything we want, he feels his conscience is very clear and proceeded to tell me about his terrible childhood when his dad used to beat his mom and he would keep his mouth shut to his father and said ""and here you are disrespecting your dad!"". I tried to argue and I said any normal person would say to him but we kept drawing circles in the argument which is his usual strategy to escape arguments. It's like he acts stupid on purpose. So to escape this circle I told him that I make him proud, and I want him to make me proud and that is only if he has a healthy conversation with my mom and he fixes this situation and apologizes. We hugged each other and my mom came to talk with him and she told me to go upstairs. I obliged.

Today mom wasn't looking happy and told me about the conversation she had with him. Apparently he told her he can do all he wants and even cheat because he provides for the family and he demands respect. Also denied my statements about him cheating, never apologized and even insulted her. She can't just divorce because she relies financially on her husband.  My dad can't really either because we are the only thing going on in his life and he probably is not going to get married again at 43. So it seems that the only option is to fix this somehow. I don't know how I'm supposed to deal with this and him. What should I do?

TL;DR Found out dad cheated on my mom, told mom, he says he can do whatever he wants because he is dad and he provides for his family.

163,163,"My friend (16F) and I (17M) were talking on discord and the conversation of WWII came up. She is Polish btw. She said that she's lucky because she is blonde with blue eyes and really white skin. She said that she'd happily join the army to help out with killing ""dumb ugly ass monkeys"". I don't know what to do now she is my best friend but I don't think I can continue talking to her after what she said.","Husband and I have been together for 4 years and married for 1. 

When we first got together he was friends with two girls who hated me off the bat because they had had crushes on him and he don’t reciprocate. I would receive messages and comments from fake accounts saying I was ugly or that I was pretty and he only wanted me for my body. We would go to events and there would be a small group of people there who would refuse to say hi or interact with me but fully interacted with my husband. After a lot of time and passive aggressive actions, he finally cut them out and blocked them. However, some of their friends who are mutuals with my husband continued to be cold towards me.

Over the last 4 years there have been periods of back and forth. For months nothing will happen and things feel great. Then suddenly someone I don’t know who is close with the 2 women will randomly view my story on Instagram without ever following me. A former friend admitted to me once that they regularly talk shit and gossip about me to people. It feels like when I see these random views on my social media it’s probably because they are all hanging out together and gossiping. I have mentioned to my husband how it’s weird and it makes me feel uncomfortable. My husband just shrugs it off and says to ignore it. He continues to talk to them and joke around on social media despite their treatment. 

I’m tired of feeling disrespected like this on both fronts. I feel that my husband should stick up for me and at least call out their behavior. Something as simple as “Why are you ignoring my wife when we’re both right here?” Or “Is there a reason you randomly followed then unfollowed my wife within a week?” At least some acknowledgement that something passive aggressive is happening and it’s being noticed and discussed between us. I wish he would present a united front with me but I feel very much alone in this right now. 

We have fought and argued about this issue many times before. Our therapist pointed out to him how it’s weird behavior for these people to do this. I’ve told him if any of my friends were disrespectful towards him, I would take it personally as disrespect towards *us*. He really believes just because the shitty behavior isn’t directed at him, that he has no reason to put distance between them or call them out. 

I’m feeling extremely depressed today about this and he’s just ignoring me, sitting on his computer. I’d like some advice on how to approach this conversation and general situation. 

TLDR: A select group of husbands friends have always treated me coldly/badly because two women in their group are upset they didn’t get to date him. I have been sent messages and ostracized at events by them. They will randomly stalk my social media and follow then unfollow me quickly. Husband sees nothing wrong enough with this for him to say or do anything. I wish we would present a united  front and send a clear message that their behavior is not ok.",True

I cannot believe that these people are letting eight men override their humanity, I cannot believe they could be such willing victims. To me, it is one of those injustices that may never be put right, and it breaks my heart to know that. 

I keep telling myself that perhaps I should shun them in return, but it is not in my nature to do that.

She's gone through phases with mom and dad, and I guess it's my turn. She also used to be mute around some people and sometimes still feels too anxious/awkward to answer verbally and you basically have to probe her with several questions to know what she wants or is thinking.

I'm not really sure what to do most of the time. Like, if she clings to me in public and hides behind me if someone speaks to her, should I just let her?

One of my good friends has been hitting on me and making moves, she’s trans from male to female and im not into trans girls. I get that she identifies as a female and im completely fine with that Im just not interested in a relationship with somebody assigned male at birth. How could I let her down without sounding transphobic?","We’ve been together five years, lived together for three. When we met we had a number of shared interests as well as our own separate things. She had DnD which I’ve never been interested in, while I had local sports and classic literature which she couldn’t care less about.

Over time that changed. She started coming with me to see live sport. She would ask me about the books I was reading. Within a year or so we would go to every event together and her collection of jerseys matched mine, and she would read any book I recommend and dissect it with me. It was wonderful. Both of us have always been solitary types, I’ve always pursued my hobbies alone and now I was able to share them with someone. And with the person I loved too!

Over time that has changed. My girlfriend is far better at communicating with people than I am (thank you, sheltered religious upbringing and neurodiversity) and she started ingratiating herself into communities around our interests. She started contributing to local sports discussions and finding herself invited to social events, meeting the athletes, volunteering for community groups. Book discussions spilled into online communities, which became visiting signings and podcasts.

Today she chairs the official fans’ trust of our local soccer team, and was granted access by the estate of my favourite author to go through his notes for the purposes of a documentary about him. I hate it. I hate all the busy-ness, all the people and back-patting and schmoozing. I don’t even want to go back to being just me and her going to games, discussing books until one in the morning. I just want to enjoy my hobbies by myself again.

I’ve looked within over and over to try and work out why I feel this way. I’ve never been a gatekeeper, I only ever want to open doors and encourage people. I don’t think I’m a misogynist or a fragile man who resents successful women. My exes include a very influential businesswoman and professional gymnast while I’ve always had a boring mid-level office job, never had any problems with jealousy or resentment there. And yet I do find myself feeling jealous and resentful of my girlfriend. Perhaps it’s because these are “my” interests and I feel incapable of making any of the social strides she’s made. Perhaps I’ve made the “lone wolf” element of my fandom into more of my identity than I realised to compensate for that.

These are new feelings for me, they’ve crept up on me and I have no idea what to do about it. I feel especially guilty because I haven’t talked to her about it. We have always been able to have difficult conversations and understand that they need to happen sometimes. Yet I feel paralysed and unable to discuss this with her.

At the end of the year we’re going abroad for a convention about one of my favourite film series. I just want to mill around at my own pace, take it all in… and I just know that she’s going to schmooze her way into charming the actors and filmmakers I adore in a way that I simply cannot. Honestly, I wish I were going by myself and I feel terrible for that.

I don’t know where to begin working any of this out and I feel so guilty for feeling this way. My girlfriend is a wonderful woman who has continued to adore me the entire time we’re together and would probably sacrifice all of her accomplishments to stay with me. I don’t feel worthy of that.

**TL;DR: My girlfriend has slowly become an influential figure in the arenas around my hobbies. I am feeling resentful of this for reasons I am not sure of and wish I could go back to simpler times when it was just me and my interests.**",True

The audacity of this man honestly","Six months ago I had a massive fight with my sister over my life choices (Edit: see comments for a longer explanation but short version is she doesn't like my marriage or my choice to take in our 1 year old sister). I don't feel that the choices I made were wrong, but there were things I said mid-argument that were over the line. She was living with me at the time, she moved out without a word the next day. I called to apologise but she blocked me. I sent her an email and she replied ""Thanks."". We've seen each other twice since then. The first time I tried to talk to her, and she told me to fuck off. The second time I didn't even try, which was just as well as she told our brother she was going to just tell me to fuck off again if I tried talking to her.

Having had some time to reflect, and some therapy, I have come to the conclusion that my life is better without my sister in it. I know that sounds horrible, but when she was in my life I was always worried about her, what she was doing, and what she'd think of my life. My siblings (38m, 32m, 27f, me, 17f, and 1f) and I all have issues, but she's the only sibling who I feel worse after talking to, because when I talk to her she tends to just take digs at my life choices. I'm just not sure what my presence in her life, and vice versa, will do at this point to make things better.

Our older brother (32m) is getting married just before the new year. I'm very happy for him, and am in theory very excited to come to the wedding, but he's now said that unless I make up with our sister, neither of us are invited. I've said I won't be hostile, I just won't speak to her, and he's said that isn't good enough, we're his sisters, he loves us and wants us to have a relationship. I feel forced into this, because I love my brother and want to be there for him, and I do love my sister, but I don't feel the need to apologise, particularly as my sister has a habit of expecting an apology without giving one back, and she said things in that argument, too, that I don't believe she feels bad for.

I want to go to my brother's wedding, and be there for him on his day. I'm also going to be bringing 1f and 17f who live with me, plus my son (4m), so if I don't go 1f and 4m can't go and 17f will have to go alone, which she isn't comfortable with, but I can't agree to reconcile with my older sister when I have no reason to believe she's changed, and aside from the comments made during the argument, which I have already apologised for, I have done nothing wrong. I have already tried to say this to my brother once, and he said that he has bigger things to deal with than our petty argument, and this is our thing to work out, even though he's the one who wants it resolved and it isn't petty.

What is my best route out of this situation, ideally one that still lets me go to his wedding?

TL;DR: Brother getting married and wants me to resolve issues with our sister before the wedding. I feel that my issues with our sister are better left unresolved but he doesn't want to hear it. I still really want to attend his wedding but not if it means catering to sister.",True

I talked to my coworker and told him  everything that was going on with me and my marriage and that I had to stop chatting and eating lunch with him. He was disappointed but said he’d respect whatever I decided. He also said that he was never intending to break up my marriage or cause me to leave my religion, that he just genuinely enjoyed talking to me and enjoyed my company. He also said if I ever needed anything, I could still come to him with no worries.

I also decided to talk to my husband. So I sat down with my husband at dinner two nights ago. We had just finished telling each other about our day. I told him that I had to tell him something he probably wasn’t going to like, but I’d appreciate if he didn’t get upset. He agreed to sit and just listen. So, I laid it all out for him, my co-worker and how I’ve bonded with him, my struggles with our faith and, then, with our marriage, my struggle to figure out who I am, everything.

To his credit he never once seemed mad at me. He almost seemed to laugh off my bringing up my coworker. He didn’t say so, but when he talked to me about it he (almost) condescendingly made it sound like a school-girl crush, and perhaps he’s right about that. He was, however, mostly concerned with my struggle with my faith. This upset him quite a bit. Not upset in anger, but upset that I might now be going to spend all of eternity in hell. 

I suggested that perhaps I needed to see a therapist or that maybe we needed couples therapy. He was not receptive or amenable to either of those ideas. Again, his main concern was my soul. He suggested that we set up an emergency zoom meeting (and possibly regular meetings) with our pastor from back home. I really did not want to do that. I knew exactly what was going to happen. I knew I would be guilted into retracting everything I’d talked about with my husband, made to feel ashamed for having a lack of faith, and, if all else failed, potentially “requested” to quit my job and possibly even move back home. My husband was insistent that we have this conversation with our pastor. I could tell he wasn’t going to agree to anything else unless I did, so I agreed.

My husband called him and within 20 minutes we were all in a zoom meeting together. It was awkward, and it was uncomfortable for me. It went exactly how I suspected it would. Since I’d already told my husband about my doubts and my feelings, there was no lying to our pastor; no way to wiggle around what I’d already admitted. He was… not understanding. 

I don’t want to get into too many of the details of what he said, but my doubts, concerns, and feelings were not treated with legitimacy and I was made to feel embarrassed and ashamed for even entertaining them. It was awful. I saw the writing on the wall, and so I didn’t push back, I relented. I gave in and prayed and asked for forgiveness and it makes me feel gross to think and talk about. 

I wish I had a better update than this, I really do. I’m now not sure at all with what I want to or what I should do.

169,169,"We have a large community of people from the East living in my city. As a server, I’ve noticed that a lot of these people don’t eat bacon as part of their religion, and I’d like to be respectful of that. A couple of times I’ve had people order a pork or ham dish unknowingly or something with bacon on it and had to send it back because they couldn’t eat it. 

I tried mentioning it if I thought they might be Muslim, but realized I might just be stereotyping people with brown coloured skin. Some were just from India and weren’t Muslim and I was embarrassed and felt like a racist. 

Once I’ve come across a white Muslim so it’s obvious anyone can be Muslim the same way anyone can be Christian so now I’m asking if there is a respectful way as a server to let someone know there is bacon in their dish if I suspect they might be Muslim? 

The problem is, I’ve never been told “I don’t eat pork” before the meal is already on the table and this has happened quite a few times.

edit: 

Thank you everyone for the helpful advice. It was something simple I had never thought of simply because I was anxious about how I was coming across/didn’t want to make assumptions. A lot of this seems to have to do with my pre-conceived ideas about different religions and races and I will be actively trying to correct my way of thinking and continue to be respectful of others religions. Again, thank you for the advice, even if it seemed silly, it really helped me.","My (27F) friend (23F) and I are both in our 20s. We’d been friends for 5 years or so.

A couple of months ago I made the decision to cut off a close friend of mine. I won’t go into specific details but whenever we argue she will always bring up something she knows will hurt me- she’s admitted she deliberately will bring up something she knows will ‘sting’ when she’s angry to get to me. An example was her laughing and calling ‘immature for getting upset over little kids’ for being upset after a horrible day at my job (I work with some very vulnerable children and had left work in tears that day) The last argument we had she accused me of something pretty horrible and that’s when I decided I was done. She also will often ask to borrow money and get shitty when I ask her to pay it back and constantly is asking me to drive her places and can be snarky if I say no.

Her mum passed away a few weeks ago. She knew she was dying but it happened quicker than expected. She has always been much closer to her dad however I know it’s still a horrendous thing to go through. I did send her my condolences and left it at that.

The funeral was this week and she messaged today asking if we could get back on better terms. She admitted to being an AH to me but said she really needs support atm. It sounds horrible but I honestly don’t want to rekindle this friendship- I overlooked so much with her that normally I wouldn’t.

I feel so guilty. Any advice to broach this situation is much appreciated- I’m at a loss.

For the other times she also got very mad at me and told me that I have to figure it out on my own, and that this shouldn’t happen to a guy. I tried explaining to her why it was happening (mostly because i get nervous and overthink when we’re about to do it), but she did not care to listen. What should i do in this situation?","TL,DR: my Fiancee has terrible house hygiene habits that she refuses to improve. She's revealing a cruel abd materialistic side that is a deal breaker. None of my requests for middle ground are being heard. 
Still, I don't want to cause irremediable pain. He ex was a bad husband. I just need to find the words to talk to her without creating a huge argument.


I ( M51) need advice calling off my. I don't wanna be hurtful. I just need the right words to say we will never get married and should break up permanently without destroying her self esteem.

I fell in love with Maggy ( F52) after a very bad health scare. I was completely taken by her big/larger body type and her fun loving facial expression. I knew she had some self esteem issues that she dragged from her past marriage. So I've done my best to help her. However, she keeps raising the bar no matter what or how much I do for her. There's always something to piss her off, or worse, something that I didn't do. 

I'm very resentful. Her ex husband treated her like crap and she still tries to maintain his friendship. I've treated her like a princess and I'm not being appreciated. 

Things have changed so much that I'm repulsed by seeing naked and I can't help it. It started after she turned our home into a pigsty. I had to hire a cleaning lady because Maggy had atrocious habits, but I decided to hold back that expense and just do it ourselves.

I come home at 2 am from the airport after two weeks of  traveling. I find that she lets our pets poo and pee on the floor and furniture, the kitchen is full of maggots and the kitchen sink was full of dirty water and dirty dishes. No toilet paper, food crumbs everywhere. Our bed had no fitted sheets. 

I had to start cleaning right that moment because we were supposed to have company that Saturday. After hours of cleaning, I had to cancel on our guests because the stench was prevalent and I needed to get a professional carpet/ furniture cleaner.

She never took responsibility. Instead, she blamed me. It was my fault, because I know she's not the cleaning type and didn't want to keep paying for a maid. I didn't feel good at all when she said with the money that I make, I could make her life easier. I've tried to work around her quirks. All I asked was that she respect what I already cleaned. I got to the laundry room and had to throw away an entire load. She put clothes in the washing machine, filled it up and forgot about them. The stink and mold ruined the garments. She said getting mad over it was me creating drama because new clothes could be purchased. I feel this is financially disrespectful. I've told her but she's not listening.

I still did my best to keep each other happy. I took her on trips and had fun outings. We've been engaged for 8 months now, but her dirty habits are affecting my mental health. Whenever she turns our home into  a dirt hole, she says ""don't judge me"" but does nothing to help me feel more comfortable. It's come to a point where her selfishness has me feeling lonely.

Our sex life has changed. I used to be very happy making sure she was satisfied. Until she took to critiquing my performance. She does climax, but likes to say things that make me insecure after the fact. For example, ""you didn't do this or that while xyz was happening"". I don't read minds. She could tell me while we are in the act. She says ""my relationship with my ex taught that blah blah blah blah blah"".

Maggie likes to parade naked around the house. I initially thought it was sexy, until she refused to use a towel to protect the furniture, specially after sex when fluids are still running. 

I can't say anything because she accuses me of ""rejecting her"" . 

The last time I had to do an emergency cleaning in the house, she was naked in the living room and it created such anger that I'm now repulsed. We can't invite anyone in. The place is always a mess. She's become an attention junkie and likes to either ridicule others or make jokes at the expense of others ( namely whoever is getting attention). We've talked about this many times. I think her friends gave her a lot of TLC during her divorce and she does not understand that the supply of attention isn't an endless one.

Her best friend, Nora, is a very good person and has truly shown that she cares about us. I'm sure Maggie just ruined it.

Nora is married to Jake. We met via Nora. Jake and I have a very close friendship. 

We attended their wedding and everything was great until we drove back home. Maggie criticized everything. After that, she hasn't really shown any enthusiasm to her friend. So Nora made an effort and came to visit. I offered the idea of an outdoors picnic because having visitors is very stressful. Nora surprised us with an amazing 4 huge trays of seafood boil. She even brought gloves and aprons. Instead of showing gratitude, Maggie took so many jabs at Nora that it began to look really unfriendly. I'm noticing things that are acts of spite.  The pain in Nora's face when she left, really, really made me question my relationship. If she does this to her best friend who helped her rain or shine, she will just run me over. 

Maggie and I had a huge argument because I said she needed to apologize. Furthermore, she ranted about Nora marrying Jake. He's very successful, he has money and he's very down to Earth. I don't live my life trying to assess people's wealth. Let him and Nora be happy and enjoy their lives. Maggy and I should be focusing on us. 

Jake called me in such a state of anger that I put him on speaker. I'm not proud of this, but he told Maggie off for making Nora cry and I kind of enjoyed it. I apologized to him. After this, I got the silent treatment from her for not standing up to him. 

For background, the jokes about Nora were about how she used to drive an old car that was ugly, how she got cheated and dumped by an ex and how she  begged that ex to take her back. There's no way I can appreciate humiliation. I've been there.  I keep asking Maggie if there's something I don't know about so that she's acting this way and she said that I need to stop. That's all in getting. 

I'm so put off and so pissed that I will not allow her to keep the ring. All of her philosophies now sound like toxic positivity. She advocates not getting angry and all that. 

I'm tempted but will definitely NOT go for cigarettes.

Also for background, she started acting out after we got engaged, although there were some red flags that I thought were temporary. 

Edit: so far there's an apartment I can rent but not inmediately available. It looks like I'll move with my nephew and his friends after I remove my stuff. I don't want to exit and  leave anything behind. If this turns out to be my most inmediate arrangement, my family will be taking in all my pets until I can move them with me.

She says she feels the urge to check on me to make sure I'm alone in my hotel room but doesn't do it because she doesn't want to be the crazy jealous wife.

We went to a concert on Saturday, and that's when everything went downhill. I had a panic attack so I went to the bathroom so I wasn't ruining it for him, admittedly that was a terrible idea, he brought it up yesterday, said that I only went to the bathroom when I wanted to avoid him.

We went out together and had planned to spend the whole day together, now I'll never see him again and I can't live with that.

They came home at about 2am, I arrived from her place maybe half an hour after that. Found my bf passed under our loft bed, gave him a blanket and went to sleep.

Today she told me.

Now, my bf swears up and down that he just sat at the bar while his brother and best friend went to the ""rooms"". His brother did confirm this, but why wouldnt he, they are brothers.

Now, what the fuck am I supposed to do. I love him and even if hes telling the truth, it is a huge breach of trust for me.

I dont want to accuse him of cheating because he seemed really genuine plus he didnt have a wallet on him, but I feel betrayed nonetheless.

Any advice on this?","I’ve had a very tough year with nearly every type of relationship in my life— romantic/sexual, familial, friendship, professional. You name it, it’s blown up in my face. I’ve been to therapy, it wasn’t great but I’m trying my best to learn from it and not give into avoidance and self-isolation. So that’s the background.

I (F24) volunteer at an animal shelter several times a week and there’s a regular group that goes at the same time, all of which are older than me. The closest one to my age is M28. It seemed natural for us to see if we are a good match romantically, but ultimately I’m not feeling anything towards him and with everything else this year I’m fine with focusing on myself and being single. We agreed to be friends back in July and I thought that settled it.

In mixed company outside of volunteering (obviously), we’ve had a few drinks and some “deep talks” (as in absolutely trauma-dumping) and usually I’m opposed to this but thought being frank would help us be genuine friends and forget about the small amount of time we considered dating. Well it turns out for the past couple months of having occasional conversations like this, it’s only served to make his feelings stronger. More than once has he said “we need to talk” and in those talks he’s said things like how he appreciates our close friendship, etc etc, relating to trauma dumping and trust and whatever.

Well last week during one of our little parties, I was joking about having a crush on someone at work, (I wouldn’t say it’s a real crush, we’ve never spoken, and I’m certainly not trying to initiate anything) and M28 burst out that he’s attracted to me and I should stop talking about things like that. I went beet red and changed the subject. It really pisses me off that he thinks I should censor myself because of feelings HE has, that I’ve done nothing to encourage.

The next day, of course, I get a text that says “we need to talk”. I purposely skip the shelter but he insists that he comes over to talk at my parents house because it’s important. (Parents were not home) So fine, he comes over, we chat a bit and then I ask “how bad is it?” He launches into some of his romantic history and how it’s so rare to have feelings this strong and I light up his day, blah blah blah. Excuse me for being callous but I’ve heard this all before. He wants sex. That’s what every single relationship and “friendship” I’ve had with men boils down to. M28 starts *crying* because I won’t just force myself to be with him. 

I offer him a tissue and he sniffs and asks for a bandaid instead because he fell down earlier and scraped his knee. Oh my godddddddd. It probably sounds like I’m shaming him for being unmanly but honestly idgaf about gender, if anyone came to my house crying because they’ve known me for 3 months and started begging me to get over myself and fuck them and then ask for a bandaid for the smallest scratch I’ve ever seen, I’d think they were pathetic. My reaction to this situation is universal, I assure you.

I was nicer in person than I’m being here, but I don’t believe for a minute that I can continue our friendship as it was. Knowing he’s this desperate to get me in bed and literally willing to grovel for it, I can’t find an ounce of respect for him anymore, and having been around desperate men before I don’t trust him or feel safe. He’s latched on to one of my favorite hobbies (crochet—weird, right?) and is trying to make plans incorporating that, but crochet is my favorite way to clear my mind *alone*. It’s pretty obvious that despite everything I said to him, he’s betting on patience and ingratiating himself to me by asking me to teach him and make things together, he’s playing the long game to get his d*ck wet.

I don’t want to have to stop volunteering here to get away from him, and what I learned in therapy encourages me to get past this to maintain the friendship. Am I insane for being this skeptical of his true intentions? Is there anything else I can do to reduce his attraction, or is my pre-therapy instinct right to gtfo ASAP?

Im hesitant to give it to management bc i dont want it to not get delivered to whoevers money it is. What would you do? No this is not a joke lol","**EDIT:** Omg, I really was not expecting so many responses... thank you so much, for real. I have read every one of them and I apologize for not responding to them all! I'll answer a few questions that I've seen repeated so that the situation is more clear:

1. We live in the US. I was born here but speak both English and Korean fluently. He moved here (and was a citizen prior to our marriage) in his 20s, so his English is weaker, and he is fluent in Russian, of course. We speak in only English together, but admittedly, sometimes there are issues since he is still learning.
2. I never intended to be completely fluent in Russian, but thought it would be cool to at least learn common phrases, and read the alphabet! I never thought I'd have a full conversation with my husband or anyone else. I do like learning, just as a hobby. So maybe I do need to just continue for myself.
3. Husband has not really helped my learning in a full-time capacity, but happy to hear me try. I can respond to a few things. And he is appreciative that I try, but it's not like he is tutoring me.
4. When I said that I feel like I sacrificed a lot for him, it's not about the language learning. He is a former pro athlete who is now a coach/trainer. There is a lot of stuff I need to do at home to make sure he is successful during the day. I also have my own career, but I get off at 5. He has lots of late nights unfortunately. I guess this language thing just felt like the straw that broke me last night.
5. He has never promised to learn my language, but I meant more like, basic phrases. He does know ""hello"" for when he visits my parent's house, but that's it. He has previously said that he doesn't have time, his brain space is limited to training and has very little space for anything else (his words, not mine lol.) So on one hand, I do understand, but it's still a little hurtful.
6. I do love him. And I know he loves me. He is not a shady person, and has no ties to Russia, except his family.

Together 2 years, married for 1. Ever since we started dating, I had always tried to learn a little bit of his language (Russian.) I always thought it sounded pretty, so it was easy for me to get into it and he seemed to really appreciate it. Fast forward, we're married, I'm still studying, but not really doing that well lol.

Yesterday we got into a weird sort of argument about him making a non-joke joke about how my Russian never gets any better, do I even study anymore? And I was like, I do study but I don't know, it's still hard! He makes like this annoyed disappointed face, so I say, you've never even tried to learn my native language. And he says that he never said he would or wanted to. And that is true... he had never offered or tried, and I was the one who volunteered to learn his language. But still, I asked him, ""well, it's my culture, don't you want to try to learn some of it?"" And he makes this face like, nah.

I asked him, why not?? And he said, ""Because I don't see a use for it.""

That actually really hurt me. I was like, the use for it would be for us to feel more connected to each other. And then he clarified, ""In the world, there's no use for it.""

We DO have some minor communication problems because he is not a native speaker, so I think that he meant like, in the world, where Korean is only spoken in one country, there isn't any real-world use for it, which I understand.

But I'm just like, why wouldn't you even pretend to try? I mean, I guess it's good he is being honest, but the truth hurts for real.

Is it stupid for me to feel this way? Am I being unreasonable? I just feel like I sacrifice so much for him and he doesn't even feel the need to learn the basics of his wife's native language. Is that stupid?

I was also thinking, I'm going to stop learning Russian now, if it's for his sake. But I don't know. Is that too petty? Should I just keep going anyway?

TLDR: Husband has no interest in learning my native language, even though I have always tried learning his. Granted, it's true he never promised to do it, but still, I feel a bit hurt. Should I stop learning his? Is that petty? Or is it just stupid for me to even feel hurt?",True

But GF's health condition has make big changes since the first year we were together. 

Previously, her bones would break easily and was frequently in some kind of cast and caught things like colds and the flu very often. But now she uses crutches when she leaves home and struggles to go up and down stairs. She is in pain every day just from going about her daily activities. She is brave and smiling and works so hard despite all this and never complains. 

I admire her and care for her so much, and I don't mind helping her with doors and carrying things for her, but this much change in just 2 years has me worried about what the future will look like. What will daily life look like in another 2 years? What about 10? How much longer will she be able to walk? Will I have to drive her to work every day? Help her out of bed? Will we never get to travel like I've always wanted? Will all of the house work and care for both our pets fall on me? Will she leave me as a widow at 40? 50? I am afraid that I may find myself as my partner's caretaker much sooner than anyone ever imagines. 

We have talked a lot about the future, but we have never talked about this part of it. I know that these worries are holding me back from committing fully to the future we have talked about, but I have no idea how to open the topic and express these worries without sounding like a jerk or coming off like I'm saying something is wrong/not good enough about her.

But last week he said something that I haven't been able to get out of my head and on top of some other stuff I'm wondering if it's worth ending a 7 year relationship over. Last week when I said no he said "" come on please? what if all you have to do is lay there"" ... It feels like he doesn't care if it's sex with me he just wants to cum.


Edit: why are some of you so mean.
Edit2 :Trust me people I know I'm not innocent I've done some fucked up things I know it but this feels big to me if I'm as bad as people keep saying than I welcome him leaving me too. Whatever is the most healthy. I just unfortunately don't know what the right answer is and I just wanted help.","Hey everyone. New to the community and looking for some friendship advice. TIA

**Backstory:** I (30F) have been good friends with my buddy Eric (33M) for 11 years. When I started dating my partner (30F) five years ago, they also got very close. Ever since, the three of us have been good pals and we have a larger friend group we spend most of our time with. Two years ago, when Eric started dating his girlfriend, Amy (36F), we all stopped seeing much of him. That’s okay, it happens! But we were all sad he wasn’t around, and we couldn’t get to know Amy. Later on, they started to join some group hangs, but all attempts to get to know Amy were not overly successful. In my opinion, our group is warm and welcoming. Everyone is really open, kind, and easy to talk to. We’ve integrated everyone’s partners over the past few years, and they’ve become just as close with all of us. But I also understand how daunting it can be to join a group of established friends, so I always make an effort to sit with Amy, ask her about her life, and make sure she feels welcome. She offers little information and rarely asks questions to keep the conversation going. Which happens, maybe we just aren’t a good conversational match, or she doesn’t like my vibe, that’s okay.

**The Event:** Recently, at a wedding Amy got drunk and made people extremely uncomfortable with inappropriate sexual comments and behavior. She made many weird and off-handed comments about Eric’s penis to a bunch of our friends, randomly showed her boobs to multiple people, and abrasively tried to show me her vagina - multiple times. When I kept saying no, she responded with: ""Are you sure? We can go into a room inside and I'll show you really quickly"". I was so uncomfortable, but I didn't know what to do other than laugh and walk away. All of my friends have been feeling really weird about her behavior and we've all started to develop negative feelings towards her. Apparently, this is also not the first time she has acted like this with our friends. I started to consider if this was a dude wiping out his penis and forcing it upon people. That's when I realized the seriousness and why I was so uncomfortable. Our group really didn’t want this to become an issue, or a reason to not invite her places, or cause any fall outs. So, my partner and I decided we would bring it up to Eric and Amy in person, tell her it made us uncomfortable, give her a chance to speak to it and make sure it doesn't happen again, and hopefully move on.

But it didn't go that way. The four of us (Eric, Amy, myself, and my partner) made plans to hang out this week. We asked if they felt they had the capacity to have a tough conversation, they agreed. We were cautious in choosing our words to make sure Amy didn't feel attacked or shamed. We were also careful to make sure we only spoke for ourselves and did not include anything our friends had said. We told her that we completely understood if she felt blindsided or overwhelmed, and we would respect if she wanted to table the discussion to talk about it later. She didn't say much and looked upset, which I totally understand. Eric tried to make a few excuses for her, but he also was understanding of our feelings. When we left, we told them that we are open to talk about it anytime or we can just leave it, but Eric assured us we would talk about it again when they felt ready. We thought it went okay. Not awesome, but okay.

**The Dilemma:** I don't think they felt the same way. The next day Eric asked my partner and I not to attend a party they were hosting later in the week, which we completely understood, but then he also left our group chat entirely. Weird. Then I realized he blocked my partner and I on social media as well, and so did Amy. We are respecting their space and not trying to contact them, but we are also confused. They are sending the message that not only is this conversation over, but so is our friendship.

I’m just not sure where to go from here. I'm hurt and confused but I'm also trying to be understanding of their feelings. Maybe this is just them taking space? Do I reach out to Eric? Do I leave it? Do I accept this friendship is over?

**TLDR;** My good friend of 11 years went no contact after I told him and his girlfriend that her inappropriate sexual comments and behavior at a party made me uncomfortable. Do I let go of the friendship? Or do I try to fight for it?

  

**UPDATE:** Thank you to everyone who has taken the time to write thoughtful, kind, and compassionate responses. I did not take the decision to have this conversation lightly and knew it could lead to the end of the friendship. However, not having the conversation would have ultimately ended the friendship as well. After much reflection and reading the many considerate posts, I have come to recognize that these are not people that I want in my life moving forward. Thank you for helping me have this realization. 

In terms of the friend group, as many of you suggested, I did update them. I kept it to the facts and did it in person to avoid miscommunication. They are all just as upset with they way Eric and Amy handled this and support my partner and I 100%. As it turns out, the rest of the group was also uninvited from the party (with no explanation), so it seems Eric has made the choice to distance himself further from the group. Everyone is not surprised by this and saw this coming anyways. 

Lastly, to the people that reminded me I did the right thing by standing up for myself and calling out problematic behavior. From the bottom of my heart, thank you. 

Y’all, sexual harassment is sexual harassment. Never feel bad about calling that shit out.

177,177,,"I was dating someone until yesterday when my mom spent hours arguing trying to force me to end things with him until I ended giving up after weeks of arguing and emotional distress and exhaustion.

I was dating him for almost two months but we already knew eachother before, everything was going well until I assumed to my mom he was my boyfriend then she automatically switched for being okay with us hanging out to being extremely strict with everything I did (not go to his house for example) and mean to him every time they saw each other.

I'm devastated, laying in my bed all day crying without talking with anyone since yesterday, emotionally exhausted because this is not the first time my mom did this, she did the same with my ex boyfriend until after three months dating we broke up because my boyfriend couldn't take her strict and mean behaviour anymore. I can't do anything because I still live together with my mom at her house. I'm trying to save money to be able to move back to my homeland because I never intended to stay in the country I am but I did because she and my brother forced us all to stay Seven years ago.

Please someone give me some advice because I am so tired of not being able to even choose who I want to love and hang out, I want to marry someday or just feel happy for loving and be loved back but how am I supposed to do so when every time I start dating my mom will keep forcing me to break up or make the guys break up with me?

My post is a total mess and I apologize for it but I am in a complete mess right now as well.

EDIT: I and my family comes from Brazil and we are living in Scandinavia right now (my father's homeland, he died 21 years ago).

UPDATE: I ended up arguing again with my mom yesterday and she slapped me several times and insulted me. Now I'm hiding my phone so she won't take it away.

LAST UPDATE: I have decided to stay until I have saved up some money and leave to my homeland to restart my life again. I will have one last talk with my boyfriend (now ex) because I don't want this situation to continue and hurt him anymore as well.

TLDR: my mom forced me to break up with my current boyfriend by phone and I don't know how to handle the situation anymore",True
178,178,"My brother’s best friend (both 27M) raped me 7 years ago, my SIL and brother are expecting. His best friend paid him $10,000 to name that child after him. how do I handle this?

my family doesn’t know about what happened 7 years ago especially my brother, when I was 12 I chose not to speak about it and dealt with the trauma alone. I have gotten used to him being around cuz he’s still my brothers best friend and I’m the one who chose to stay silent, it’s not that child’s fault but I don’t think I could love him if he’s named after the best friend.","Update: First of all, thank you for all the comments and the messages of support. For those that said 8 billion people and I decided to fuck his friend, ok I see what youre saying. For those saying this is made up and sounds like a movie, thank you. Lol never thought my life was entertaining but if it did entertain you then thanks for watching. Most of you will not like this update though. While most say that I should just go NC with ex husband, he was a good man to me. We talked again yesterday and I did not say sorry for what I said to him. I was planning to just set boundaries like what most said  but keep communication. He apoligised for calling me names, the conversation started off good. However, he said he contacted Mark and told him how much I wanted to be with him I'm even moving to NZ for him and this just blew my mind. I never said that. He said Mark seems non chalant about my moving and told me maybe this feeling was one sided and adviced me to stop these feelings because I will just get hurt and Mark doesnt seem to care. I was fuming with anger. I told him ok I was planning to just set boundaries but you know what? I'm gonna continue my ""one sided"" feelings and f$&* his brains out when I get back to NZ. And then I blocked him and I've requested changing my number, etc. I will be starting a new life. As for Mark, I've decided to just not reply for now. I really enjoyed our time during vacation and i have ~ feelings ~ too. And he was nothing but nice to me. But I haven't fallen in love for a long time, so I just dont know what these feelings are. I feel like I'm too old for this stuff. As much as I wanted to go yolo, I'm taking into consideration that I'll only be in NZ for 6months for the project and what would happen next? I will be traveling a lot for my new position so I dont think any relationships would help me as a non believer of LDR. I'll still go to NZ for the job, I'll be there early December. Anyway, I have accepted after divorce that I'll probably grow old and die alone lol and maybe will continue with that plan lol. Thank you again for all the well wishes and support.

Me (33f) and my ex-husband (34m, lets call him John) were together since college, decided to get married a few years after graduating and divorced 2years ago. A total of 15years together.

It was a clean break and it was mutual. We still talk from time to time and we didnt really block each other from social media so I know he's dated so many times after our divorce.

I haven't really dated anyone since then because I was busy and just focusing on my career. Last week I finally decided to take a vacation. It was my first solo trip to another country & I decided to go to New Zealand. There were plans at work that a project might be done there.

On this vacation, I accidentally bumped into Mark. He was one of John's room mates back in college. They were close back then but slowly went no contact after grad, because Mark went to NZ and is still living there.

Mark asked me why I was alone and where John was and I said we divorced 2yrs ago. To make it short, we had dinner and then he took me on tour the next day and we kept going out together. He was really nice and lovely and we just really hit it off and had so much fun. He actually even asked if we can exclusively date, and as much as I wanted that, I dont believe in LDR.

Yesterday, I got back home and uploaded travel pics on social media. One of the pics, Mark's arm was around me. John messaged me and asked about the pictures. And if I planned to go there to see Mark. I said no and it was a coincidence I met him there. Then he said ""oh i thought something was finally gonna happen in your love life been a long time since you dated""

And then I got a big news from my boss. I will be sent to New Zealand for work for the project. It was a promotion I've been eyeing for years since I will be the head manager. I was so excited and I told Mark. Then I thought I'd reply to John too saying ""Looks like something really might!!""

John called and asked what I meant and then I told him  that I will be going to NZ for work and so something might actually happen in my love life. I was even laughing. John was suddenly pissed and accused me I planned this all along. And that I betrayed him. And I was a b1+@$ for ""chasing"" a relationship with one of his friends. I was shocked because I didnt think it was a big deal. Then he said Mark had feelings for me during college days and I was one of the reasons he went NC with him. I got mad and accused him of lying.

I casually asked Mark if he really had feelings for me back in college and he confirmed.

Now I feel guilty for going out with Mark and having second thoughts even meeting with him again. I feel like I broke an unwritten rule. John dated but never dated any of my friends - even long lost friends.

I dont really know what I'm asking here. I've been out from the daring game for a long time now so any advice would be great, thanks!

TLDR ex got really mad at me for going out with his friend he's been NC for a long time now and I thought it wasnt a big deal but turns out this friend had feelings for me from way back

Edit for clarification: I will not be moved permanently to NZ. It is just a 6-month project and if we do our jobs right, we won't need to extend longer than that",True
179,179,"My boyfriend had this friend he’s known for a few years. recently, before he committed suicide, he tried to contact my boyfriend. He was the only contact he tried calling, and they are blaming him for his suicide. I keep trying to tell him it’s not his fault, and you can’t predict that kind of thing. But, the whole family is putting the blame on him. What do I say to him?","My husband and I have been together for 10 years. He is on the spectrum and for a long time I thought the neurodivergent traits all pertained to things that I could compromise on, such as a lack of sexual and romantic interest. I felt like I loved him enough to see past what he couldn't give me in these departments. We were best friends and an inseparable team. We have a home together and have relied on each other for everything. Neither of us have many friends. In the last month I've had what I would call some sort of emotional awakening. I've realized that I felt rejected every day. I was using social media and shopping as outlets to feel attractive for a very long time.
Our communication is lacking and our conflict resolution is very poor. I will frustrate him and he'll throw something (nowhere directed at me) or bash his head into a wall. He'll say things he didn't mean, ""it is too exhausting for me to try to put any more effort into our relationship"", ect. I've asked him to change this and it never has happened. Yesterday I confessed how I felt and the problems I've had, that I don't feel like he's ever been in love with me. The relationship has felt distant for a time, so I don't think this was a shock. He was pushing me to ""rip the bandaid off"", so I just did. He packed a bag and left last night. I miss him so much and it hurts so damn badly. I feel so selfish and cruel. I know I'm not responsible for his emotions, but knowing I hurt him is ripping my heart in half. I know I'm everything to him and he would do anything for me. He's tried so hard to give me a good life. Please can someone give me some insight?

180,180,"My (17f) male friend (18m) was planning on losing his virginity to me. I told him ""maybe"" and nothing more than that, then he actually thought i was for sure going to take his virginity. But then, earlier today, he had a plan and everything and i just played along with it. Then he started asking questions like what i would want done to me, i responded with a simple ""IDK"" because i didn't actually want to do it with him but didn't want to tell him. Then i finally told him i didn't want to lose my virginity to him and he became annoyed it seemed even though he already knows i friendzoned him before. What do i tell him??

Update/backstory/edit?:
He dated my ex best friend (17f), and he already knows I have a crush on his cousin (16m). He always asks questions like “what would happen if we were locked in a room together?” and “what turns you on?”. I told him 2wice already that I’m not attracted to him only platonically.","I'm feeling sad when spending time alone while my wife is away for work for several days at a time.

We have a 5yo daughter that gives me plenty to do in the meantime, but at the end of the day I'll have 1-3 hours on my own that will feel decidedly sadder than the rest of the day.

Wife always goes on a trip for a weekend, so she'll leave on Thursday early morning and come back at noon on Sunday. She does this once or twice a month. I miss her so much while she's away and sometimes get anxious thinking about anything bad happening to her on the flight back home.

Days without her are just regular days, I go to work, come back home, have dinner with our daughter, then she'll go to sleep and I'll be in our room wishing she was there. Sometimes I read, play videogames, etc., and it certainly helps but still feel bad she's away. Videocalls or phone calls don't help that much to be honest, they kinda just make me long for her more.

And sometimes there's also an anxious feeling of ""if we don't spend that much time together on weekdays and she leaves sometimes for 2 weekends a month, I'm afraid I'll regret how little time we spend together years from now"".

Like, OK, I understand feeling a bit sad but not angsty teenager levels of sad. I've also tried to think of it more like ""she's out there being good at her job, makes me so proud of her"" and it kinda didn't work. 

How to not feel so sad when she's away?

181,181,"There’s this autistic boy at my school and he keeps asking if he can come to my party. I don’t wanna be rude but I don’t want him to come. He keeps bringing it up and asking for the address, I’ve managed to avoid answering but it’s getting irritating. I’m not excluding him specifically, anyone I couldn’t see myself hanging out with or being friends with Isn’t invited. He just really wants to go and seems really excited. I know I should just tell him straight up, but I can’t because I’ll feel really bad. Any advice??","She has a large back tattoo and one on the upper side of her arm with our daughter's name and is thinking of getting more. She's always loved tats, even getting excited when seeing cool tats on other people.

When we had our daughter(which was more or less 18 months into our relationship) she talked about me getting a tat to match the one she got with our daughter's name. I told her tattoos aren't my thing and she was fine with it. We were friends for years before dating so she's known my stance on it. I can appreciate it on other people but its not for me.

A week ago she said she wants to get one on her wrist but wants it to be a matching one with me also getting one. She really pushed for it this time, talking about how cute it'd look, how I know back in early 20s she always imagine her partner would have matching tattoos. I said no again and she sulked.

The next day she said I at least owe her that since I haven't proposed. I reminded her why that is and she stopped arguing. She had undiagnosed BP and a while back walked out on me and our daughter. Since then she's gotten into therapy, is taking her meds and things have been smooth but I still don't feel we're there yet for marriage.

She's now guilt tripping me, saying she's asking for something so small and I can't give it to her.

I'm not sure where to go here. This isn't affecting our day to day, she's still a great mom and housekeeper so I don't think this is her disorder acting up, but the passive aggressiveness shows no sign of stopping anytime soon.

182,182,Edit: I ate two pieces about four hours ago and I feel perfectly fine. I am planning on eating the whole damn thing,"TLDR at bottom. 


My wife is chronically ill and has had chronic pain since she was an early teen. She's survived cancer twice but the type of cancer she has is a mutated gene and it comes back 100% of the time. She had to have most of her intestines and colon removed because of it when she was young, but the way they did the surgery messed her up ever since. On top of that she has a condition where her body will create excess amounts of scar tissue. So what she had left of her intestines have been turned in to a J pouch. That J pouch has fused to her uterus and now because of that, among many auto immune diseases, she has intense chronic pain daily. She also has autism but was not diagnosed with it until she was about 29 or 30. Because of this she's also gotten herself in to horrible situations, been abused a ton, and has a ton of trauma. We started dating 5 years ago. She told me in the beginning that she was sick, and that she had trauma but not to the extent of how intense it actually was. Ever since then I've made it my goal to keep her in a safe environment and aid her in having a better life. Honestly it's been the hardest thing I've ever done. She's kind of a large threat to herself at times. That, among the countless things she can't do that I have to make up for over the years has really beat me in to the ground. This unfortunately has caused turmoil in our relationship at many times but that's to be expected when you put that much stress on yourself. I'm not complaining, I chose this lifestyle but that's just the truth of it. 

   Well, despite my efforts of trying my hardest to improve her life and make her want to stay on this earth she has recently this year decided to do M.A.I.D. For those of you who don't know what that is it's Medical Assistance In Death. She got approved and before that I just didn't think it was gonna be a real thing. She has chosen the date though, and as of right now it's a go in 7 months. I mean... I dunno what to say other than I'm numb but devastated at the same time. I drive truck for a living so I'm alone alot with my ear buds in. Sometimes I'll hear something in a podcast, or a song and just start really thinking about the reality of the situation I'm in. I'll have a total breakdown and start fighting off tears while I'm driving down the highway. Other times I'm so numb to it that we joke about it. But most of the time it feels like it's not real. Like I literally have to convince myself it's real sometimes. I don't know if that's my brain's way of helping me get through it or if I'm depressed and just don't know it. I'm not sad most the time, I'm just very neutral. If I have any emotion more often than not it's a feeling of total defeat. I feel like I didn't do good enough and that I should do better but I'm honestly soooo exhausted. 

    Maid has been obviously hard to deal with but at the same time has been a blessing. It's the first time the medical system has shown interest in actually helping her and I. Since she has chosen maid, we now have help. The doctors and nurses treat her better, and they're actually prioritizing her. Now how fucked up is that?! I mean some nurses and doctors were good prior to maid, but the majority threw her to the way side and treated her like a nuisance. Why does it take someone to set a plan in place to end their life before these professionals actually show compassion and empathy? It seems like it should be part of the job. Like how is a customer service position held to a higher standard than someone taking care of other humans??? I don't know. That's just a sad part of it all. 

    I apologize for the life story but this is the reason I really came here. I work week days between 10hrs and 12hrs. I also am pretty busy most of the time either having to fix our vehicle or trying to make time for my passions. She knows this and is completely fine with it. In fact she has been the least ""needy"" girl I've ever been with. To the point that I sometimes wonder if she cares that I was there at all (she does). Anyways, I've made it clear that I want us to take full advantage of the little down time that I do get and spend undivided, quality time together. The problem is, she's obviously on disability and because of the medication she takes she doesn't wake up untill between 1pm and 5pm most days. She also has a love for crafting with clay, a love for drawing,  a love for art in general (which I strongly encourage her to keep doing because she loves it so much and is insanely talented) so she ends up wanting to spend a lot of her day doing that. If she is too sick to do clay or draw she'll be on her iPad watching YouTube, Netflix, reddit, ect.. Well I'm home between 2pm and 7pm after work and have to be in bed at the latest by 11 because my morning starts at 5am. I ask her all time to come spend quality time with me before I go to sleep since it's such a small window of time and she says things like ""okay I'm just gonna finish this"". Since she has a habit of getting very fixated on things (her autism), she won't be done that task for at least a half hr. Usually much much longer, as in hrs. By the time she's done that, has taken her medication, gotten in to her pjs, brushed her teeth, grabbed water, got distracted fixating on something random, and gotten all her side table stuff together for bed, I'm either on the verge of falling asleep or she had woken me up getting in to bed. Even when she DOES make it in to bed on time she will shove her iPad in front of her face while sitting next to me and call that ""quality time"". Trust me, there's no prying her iPad out from her face. This is almost every night. 

    I've tried multiple things like coming and checking on her to remind her, trying to set a designated time, trying to catch her attention with a show she might like, giving her space and just letting her do her thing, calling her out on it, leaving the house to go for a drive to see if it'll make her miss me (she literally doesn't even notice I'm gone and thinks I'm downstairs), and it's actually even started fights from my end. Which I hate, because all I want to do is spend quality time with my wife and not regret that I didn't once she's gone. I feel so alone tbh. I feel like it's such a race against time and I'm losing precious moments. I constantly feel it slipping away from me. I'm trying my hardest to come up with new ways to approach it but I'm out of ideas. It's honestly one of the very few problems we have other than the obvious things that go along with poor health. What would you guys do? I'd be interested to know how you would approach this problem. Should I just be happy she's doing what she loves, not try to force the quality time, and make the best of the little we do get? I do realize she's addicted to her iPad because it's an easy distraction from her reality and she knows that too but trying to get her to work on that would be like dragging a 500lb boulder up a cliff. I've tried trust me. 

TLDR: Wife is chronically ill and has chosen medical assistance in death in 7 months. Im trying to spend as much quality time with her as possible but work long hrs and have a busy schedule. She has autism and gets distracted/fixated on things during the little time we both have free so we end up rarely spending quality time together. Despite my efforts in approaching the situation in many different ways I have failed to find an effective way to get that quality time with her often and so I fear I will deeply regret it once she's gone.",True
183,183,"I have been best friends with this girl for over eight years. She does stay very far away now, so we hardly get to see each other. She is supposed to stay with me this coming up Friday for a week because she will be home for Christmas. Last night, my boyfriend went through my phone. He never goes through my messages with her because I’ve told him out of respect not to because she talks about her personal business. 

Well, he went through our text thread last night. I told her and she was rightfully upset. She basically told me that she couldn’t be friends with me anymore because she couldn’t trust me and that he shouldn’t be in her business knowing what’s going on in her life (that it was a breach of privacy). Since it happened, she said doesn’t want anything to do with me, she is done being friends with me and has cut me out her life. 

I’ve apologized profusely and told her I really didn’t know he was going through our messages till after the fact. She still isn’t having it. Is this a little extreme? Eight years of friendship over something I didn’t know happened until afterwards?

Edit: since y’all are coming for my damn neck. I never said she didn’t have a right to be mad/upset/pissed off. I also didn’t take my s/o side. Why would I take the side of someone who is in the wrong? I let him know how fucked up it was and how it was a breach of trust. If the same thing happened to me, I’d be feeling the exact same way. However, I couldn’t end 8 years of friendship over something like that. All I was asking was if other people could do that over this being the ONLY EVER breach of privacy. . Now that I know that time doesn’t matter, and that it is possible it’s a closed discussion. And there was an underlying matter for her to end an 8 year friendship that had nothing to do with me, nor him. But something to do with a female she is dating. Thank you.","This co-worker has been with us for a few months and people generally like her, she's very capable and pleasant to be around, helpful, etc.

We often work together on certain things but don't share an office or interact closely most of the day. We interact when work calls for it, and sometimes during lunch. I don't have a particularly close relationship with her, but I'm finding myself thinking of her a lot and how much she reminds me of my sister, who passed over 10 years ago at 19 years old.

I find myself trying to be very kind to her when helping her with whatever it is we are doing. She's got some skills to work on and I've been helping with some of them. That's not unusual, nor have I dedicated excessive time to her, but I do feel very different around her, compared to other coworkers in her position, like I want to treat her as a daughter, or like I'm compensating for all the times my sister and I weren't in the best terms, or whenever I mistreated her unfairly.

I don't think she registers me as anything other than a superior, so there's no mutual feelings of any kind, as far as I can see.

Being around her is making me feel very taciturn and nostalgic, and I don't know how to work it out and get over it.

How do I get over this?

184,184,My girlfriend who I’ve been dating for 6 months is a size queen. She is constantly comparing my penis size to her ex penis who was 8 plus inches. Even while being intimate she will say things like when todd penetrated me I would mourn and grasp but when you penetrate me I don’t even notice. This is make me so insecure that I don’t even want to be intimate with her anymore. Advice ?,"We've been dating for about 9 months. We've been friends for 3 years. 

A couple months before we started dating he went through a very rough patch. i was there with him through it all. for months I've called him and made sure he ate lunch and dinner. We've been through a lot together. i love him i really do. he was my first kiss. i told him about my history with self harm and he was very understanding. he's been very patient and understanding with me.

During the rough patch, he started smoking cigarettes and doing weed. Not everyday but often. I tried to help him quit smoking, he said he wanted to. But it's been close to a year and he keeps quitting and going right back to it. And he's even lied to me about it a few times.

Before we started dating, i told him i wasn't on board with the smoking and weed, and he said he wants to quit.

The weed. His best friend gets him weed and they smoke together, a lot. Look I'm not a prude, I smoke weed too on occasion. But he gets out of hand. He'll do it every two days. Even after I've told him I'm not comfortable with it. and im tired and annoyed esp because sometimes he calls me and asks me to drive him somewhere because he is too high to. 

He always has fun getting high, obviously ig. I don't want to be the villian everytime and stop him, but there's boundaries, atleast to me.
He showed up to work high off his ass the other day. And i got mad. His reason was that his best friend said lets do it and he couldn't say no. His reason literally was that he doesn't know how to say no. He risked his job for that.

I realised i couldn't do it anymore. I can't keep trusting him to stop only for him to do it again. I can't keep waking him up for work every single day, can't keep making excuses at work for why he doesn't show up, can't keep making sure he's eating. I'm not his mom. And i barely have a hold of myself, how do I take care of him too.

He keeps saying he'll stop and goes right back to it. and i know that it's not like he's doing something wrong, it's me that's not okay with it. 

So i told him that we should find other people, people that we won't have to change for. Because i dont want him to change for me. He said he'll stop . But how am I supposed to trust him after him doing it so so many times.

He started crying and screaming and having panic attacks. for two hours i sat there holding him, because he was dizzy and passing out. In the middle of a break up. I had to call his best friend to come get him.

An hour later, he comes to my house and says -
"" it's not over yet. We can't give up like this.""
what the-?? What the fuck. 

I just didn't have it in me to break his heart again in the span of an hour. and i was too scared he'll cry again. Because what I saw earlier traumatized me. i was in shock. 

He wants to take a break instead of breaking up and he says that he'll take the time to work on himself.
i don't know if I can trust him again though

TL;DR: my boyfriend keeps smoking and doing weed after promising to quit 100s of times. I'm tired of being responsible for him and tried breaking up, but he won't let me and keeps saying a break would be better and he'll stop the smoking and weed",True
185,185,"My(14f)  parents are hoarders, literally the only part of our house that was clean was my room. The teachers at school noticed my extremely poor hygiene(bathtub full of dirty clothes and cat shit so no showers and the washer and dryer are filled with moldy clothes and trash so all my clothes smelled horrible) they made me promise to never tell anyone but I had a breakdown and told my teacher everything.

She notified cps and the person who came said that our house was one of the worst shes ever seen. I've been with my grandparents now and honesty I feel like this is partially my fault since I could have done more to keep the rest of the house clean. Am I partially to blame for this situation?","Hey all,

I live in a city far away from where I went to college. A few years ago, a couple who went to that college, Larry and Cate, moved to my city. I hit it off fast with them despite not knowing them when I was in school and we all hung out together.

Over the years, Larry and I grew closer. We ended up working together nearby pre-Covid and would get lunch a lot. He and Cate actually moved closer to me and we ended up (independently) getting the same type of dog over which we all bonded and had our pups over for many playdates.

I considered them to be very close friends. Larry also had numerous health problems which I offered help to Cate and him for and he seemed appreciative of it.

This weekend they got married and I was not invited. 

While I know I am not owed anything in life, I can't lie and say I'm not extremely hurt by this for a few reasons.

1. It was a large wedding. Wasn't like they eloped or kept it to family only. Nearly all of our mutual friends were invited.

2. One of the aforementioned friends was invited at the last minute so it wasn't a money issue: they just didn't include me.

3. They both talked about the wedding plans with me beforehand and never invited me.

4. We are still on speaking terms. In fact, Larry reached out to me a few weeks ago wanting to get the dogs together. 

At this point it's clear that I clearly overestimated the friendship and I feel like an idiot for doing that. However I'm not sure where to go from here. I think I'll be pulling back from Larry and Cate for the sake of my own mental health, but I also don't know if I should have a talk with them about this or how I'm feeling. 

Again, I recognize that I'm not owed anything but I also feel like I can be hurt and allowed to be hurt. I personally think our friendship is over but should I just let it go quietly? I don't plan on being rude if I see them again but gone are the days of me reaching out to see how Larry is doing or offering to watch their dog.

186,186,"I (27F) recently started going to the gym and I had encountered with women wearing yoga pants or bike-shorts that become see-through when they are doing some exercises. I don’t know if I should tell them about it, because I do not know how or how it could impact their confidence to go back to the gym. I know that I would love to be told but I would be so afraid to go back. What should I do?

Edit: the bottoms are see-through ONLY when squatting.","My fiance (27f) and i (30m) have been together for nearly 1.5 years and we've been engaged for about a year. Because of my job I had to move out of the state and we've been long distance relationship for over 6 months now. Ever since I've left, I noticed she stopped wearing the engagement ring. While we're on the phone I would ask if she's wearing it and she would say no. She says she doesn't want to ""dirty it"" and wants to save it. But she doesn't wear anything else on the ring and it makes me feel weird. She really was excited to get engaged and loved it, and now she doesn't even wear it. And it doesn't make me feel any better that she has a job that interacts with a lot of people and many people compliment her on how pretty she is. 

Lately, we got into some heated arguments about the ring and my expectations of her to wear it regularly as I have spent 2.5 months wage into buying her a ring she dreamed of. She says ""it's not like we're married"" and doesn't really wear it. It got pretty heated and I was annoyed so out of frustration I said ""if you're not going to wear it, you might as well as give it back"". I felt like the least she could do was wear an engagement ring how to commitment to each other but she won't do that. So she won't wear the ring (or anything else on the ring finger) nor will she give me the ring back. 

I told her we can start planning on getting married once our job will align in the same state (which may take about another 6-12months). Am I being unreasonable to expect her to wear the ring regularly?

Edit: few things that are coming up so I wanted to provide clarity 

1. The ring is comfortable for her. It's not too tight or bothersome when she wears it. She's been given other alternative such as silicone ring and Tiffany band to wear since she wanted to save the engagement ring but won't wear bands as ""those are for married people"".
2. I wasn't staking a claim by getting engaged early. In fact, she was the one who wanted to get engaged super early and even wanted to move in with me. She would tell me daily how her ring finger is empty and how it needs something shiny on it. I was happy with her and saw a good future together, so I tapped into my savings to give her what she wanted (I wanted too). 
3. Yes, I realize we got engaged very quicky, read 2 again. 

Tldr: fiance won't wear the engagement ring while in long distance relationship. Won't wear anything on engagement ring nor give the ring back",True
187,187,"My parents have been gone for the past week and I’ve been watching my younger siblings. The youngest can shower themselves but “Annie” (13f) cannot. She isn’t mentally or physically disabled she just doesn’t want to/can’t. My mother sort of did everything for her. A week as gone by since my parents left and she hasn’t gotten a bath. I have asked Annie about bathing herself (I’ll fill up the tub for her) but this usually ends in her getting angry or crying. I don’t know what to do. I don’t feel comfortable bathing her, but she refuses to even try doing it herself. My parents will be upset if Annie isn’t bathed at least once. I’m sort of stuck on what to do.

Edit: I’m 16 btw","I went on a date with my engaged friends friend and it went horrible


So I’m not good at dating. But the worse part was how she vented to my engaged friends about how bad it was. So my name is Chris(26m) and my engaged friends are Ashley(27f)and David(29m). They are engaged to each other. So Im not good at talking to women. I’ve tried but I’m just horrible at getting a date. My friends set me up with one of their friends that I didn’t know. Well I showed up and she looked amazing. So we sat down and ordered and talked. I thought it was going really well. We didn’t kiss or anything but I didn’t think she hated it. I drove her home and said goodnight to her and she went inside. I texted her that I had fun and would want to do it again. She agreed. 


I went to hang out with my Ashley and she said she was sorry about the date and how bad it went. I asked what she meant and she showed me the texts and I felt really sad. She said how I was annoying and too ugly and she tried not to gag looking at me. How overweight I was And she also said that we agreed to not do it again. She said it was the worst date she’s been on. Ashley apologized to me profusely and said she didn’t know her friend was like that and cut contact with her. 

Now I know I’m not a super model but I didn’t realize I was that ugly. I’ve had dates in the past that didn’t go well but I didn’t realize that I was that bad of a date. I’m having trouble looking at myself in the mirror and seeing positives about myself. Ashley wants to set me up with another friend and promises that what happened doesn’t happen to people often. And that the date was just a b. But I’m scared to go again. I mean my confidence is at an all time low right now. And I don’t think me going on a date looking how I do is smart. David and Ashley have reached out to me about hanging out or about setting me up but I’ve been avoiding them. I don’t want to leave my house. 

I don’t know what to do. Do I try the date and everything goes wrong again or do I just stay in my house and hide from everything?


TL:DR Date went really date and I’m feeling really sad.",True
188,188,"UPDATE: OKAY! So I consulted with a family friend who is a lawyer and IF THIS GETS OUT I CANNOT BE ARRESTED!! My state has odd statutory rape laws that DO NOT apply in this case. HOWEVER there is still the case of a hostile work environment! He recommended going to the manager once more and explaining the true weight of the situation, and told me to go to HR if they do nothing. He also said to try to find a way to contact his parents in an attempt to let them know that he needs serious help. Thank you so much for all the advice and for helping me relax bout a situation that is fairly easily taken care of!! I'll update again if anything else happens

Alright! So I don't know what to do about any of this. I (20F) am a server at a local restaurant. I have a decent amount of underage coworkers that I'm always nice to because I remember what it was like to be a teenager around adults who hated me. However, this one busser (16M) has gotten some sort of delusion in his head that we're dating, and I'm worried it's going to ruin my life.

I've heard from coworkers who are my age AND who are his age and go to school with him that he's been saying we've had sex, I've performed sexual acts on him, and that my long-term partner who I talk frequently about at work is a cover story. Apparently he's said these things both at work (less of the lewd rumors) and at school CONSTANTLY.

I've spoken to him about this, I've spoken to my managers (unfortunately they can't schedule me around him, against corporate rules.) Every single time someone mentions these rumours I vehemently disspell them, but it's all just getting worse and I'm afraid he's going to absolutely ruin my life.

Unfortunately quitting isn't an option as this is the only place I can work with my school schedule, and I've gone as far as threatening legal action. I'm at a loss as to what to do to make these rumours stop besides finding a way to contact his parents and begging them to get him help. What do I do?! I'm constantly on the verge of a panic attack...","She's a friend of my boyfriend from university. I met her once at my boyfriend‘s birthday party a year ago. They were having fun remembering the evenings the two of them spent together drinking wine.

A couple of weeks later he told me he would be meeting up with her to have a few glasses of wine again.  
I then asked him how he knew her and if there was ever anything between them. He just said 'No, but she would be pretty... she's always been in relationships though.‘ That was the end of the conversation.  
He apparently didn't end up seeing her because he was too busy. He never mentioned her again for a whole year.

Last week I asked my boyfriend if she would come to his birthday party this summer again and if he ever saw her over the year since he never mentioned her. He reluctantly admitted 'Yes, I might have seen her once or so'. I kept on asking and then it turned out he drove over an hour to spend the evening with her at her parents' house a couple of months ago. I wanted to know why he didn't tell me about it (we ask how each others day went everyday!) and he was just ''I probably just forgot to tell you or I didn't want to make you worry, I don't know"" ""You're making a big deal out of nothing."" ''Am I not allowed to have pretty female friends'' ""You're being extremely jealous'', “You‘re overreacting“,...  

Apart from that, she also came to his parents restaurant with her family twice or so over the year and probably saw him as well. At least he did end up saying (completely annoyed though):'I will deliberately tell you beforehand when I see her in the future'. The next time we had a conversation about this he wanted to reassure me their friendship is purely platonic.

Anyways, I used to feel like I can trust my boyfriend 100%, and now I am constantly worried. Around that month that he met up with her I had this weird gut feeling that he has met someone else or that I can't trust him anymore... I've talked to him about his female friend three times after finding out but I still don't feel better. I would like for the relationship to work and I want to trust him, but I don't know how to go about this. What can I do to be able to trust him again fully?  


TL;DR : She's an old friend of my boyfriend who he has spent a lot of evenings drinking wine with. I met her once at a party and I asked who she was. He said she's and old friend, nothing ever happened between them but that she would be pretty and that she’s always been in relationships. He never mentioned her again for a whole year. I asked him about her a week ago and it turned out that he drove over an hour to see her for an evening at  her parents house a couple of months ago. We talk about our day everyday and he didn't mention seeing her. When I told him that it bothered me that he wasn't honest he told me I'm overreacting. I want our relationship to work but I can't fully trust him anymore.


Edit: Should I tell him I sometimes feel so bad about it it‘s making me consider leaving the relationship?
Edit Edit: I used to feel really secure in the relationship because I was his first ever girlfriend and the first girl he ever introduced to his family (even though I am sure he had other options) and he made me feel really special. 

Edit Edit Edit: I’m currently at my boyfriend’s place and skimmed through their messages... He met up with her in March. She messaged him at 1:30am „Did you get home safely“, he was like „Yes, everything went well“ and she wrote „I had a really nice time with you😊“. He then messaged her about once a month asking her how she‘s doing and inviting her to his events or asking if she wants to meet up but she always cancelled... I didn‘t go any further back than March",True
189,189,"For the past few weeks I noticed she was getting kinda clingy and dropping hints. I was kinda hoping she wouldn’t do anything about it but she just told me she has something to tell me after school, I pressed her on it and she basically said its a secret and that its not bad unless I take it bad. I am absolutely terrified I just helped her out of a depression phase and she wasn’t eating for a long time. She is super sensitive and I am so scared what will happen and how I should respond. I probably shouldn’t be asking reddit but what do I do?

Thank you everyone who commented and my apologies for not adding crucial details to my initial post! I initially didn't add that my ex has access to an instagram and tiktok of our dog Astro, both of which she follows. I don't think my ex is a bad person but she wasn't good to me in our relationship.

So I (27F)  told my ex (26F) that I no longer wish to keep contact. I did this a couple days ago and I was walking on eggshells when texting her. I wrote

""Hey thanks for helping me buy Astro and being there for him. Would you be okay if we didn't text anymore? You can always check in on his tiktok and instagram. Hope this isn't rude to say or anything!""

Looking back I feel so dumb for wording it this way, I wish I worded it the way someone commented to word it.

She was not happy and texted back

""It is RUDE. We bought him together and you told me you'd update me on how he's doing. I don't care about you and have never cared about you, all I've cared about is Astro. If you really don't want to text anymore fine then, this will be my last text to you. I seriously hope you never get a pet with someone again just to ditch them later""

So ouch. I didn't know how to respond so I didn't. I'm coming to terms with the fact that I always have been and always be the bad guy in her eyes. I showed my sister, girlfriend, and friends the text and explained the situation and they don't think I'm in the wrong. I can't help but feel shitty still but tbh I felt that way a lot when I was dating her.

One of my friends suggested I send her the other half of payment for Astro, my sister thinks my ex has no respect for me, and my gf has been sweet and giving me neutral thoughts like ""Now you both can move forward and start new chapters of your lives now that you're not in contact anymore""

I feel like the cord connecting me to my ex has been cut but this worry in the back of my head says she'll message me again.

Thanks for letting me vent and giving me your thoughts in opinions :')

TL;DR: Texted my ex I no longer which to keep contact since she has access to a tiktok and instagram of the dog we bought together. She said she'll no longer text me and told me not to do this to someone ever again. I feel better but still a little anxious!",True

This is a good update actually. So, it's been a little over 3 months since I posted. To quickly recap, my boyfriend had purchased a house with his brother and sister in law about a year ago - just a few months before I was in a relationship with him so I had no say in the matter since I was not around. A big 4-family victorian that they wanted to convert into a 2 family, the majority of the space and house decisions going to his brother. Obviously, I was not okay with this arrangement for a multitude of reasons...but there wasn't much I could do besides voice my input.

After reading through all of your responses on my original post, which I was super appreciative of, I decided to hold off on moving in with him. It was not a situation I wanted to move into immediately until I got a better feel for how things would go between him and his brother + house. I also have a very nice apartment and do not want to give that up so fast. My boyfriend was definitely a bit bummed when I told him but he understood.

So...I decided to wait things out and see if my boyfriend would naturally come to to terms with the fact that long term it wouldn't be a good decision for us as a couple. A few of you had said since his heart was invested in the house and there wasn't much persuasion I could have on him. I did not push him on anything. I just let his brother's bad decisions and my boundaries do the talking. For example, if we were to move into the upstairs unit together, my boyfriend originally wanted to open up a door to the other side into the brothers unit. He said the brother wouldn't come through and that it would be private for us. I firmly disagreed and lamented on the current facts of how the situation is downstairs with the same kind of hotel door pathway to his side. (dog barking noise, invasion, not exactly private or ""our space""). He eventually agreed to not open up the door and only have the front door...AKA a normal house, not a hotel... His brother is also pretty rash so he frequently will start up drama with him through text messages.

Well just last week, his brother decided to text him and basically said ""I don't think the house is going to work out. I am not going to be happy with the house with how things are going now. You are at \[GFs\] house all the time. she just wants her own private getaway. she doesnt seem to get along with the dogs. etc..."" To which my boyfriend said yes, i think it would be healthier for me and \[GF\] to get our own house. Therefore, there is no more talk of us moving into that house permanently!!! I was SOOOO relieved it came from his brother because I did not have to push him out of it, his brother did. Which FYI - my boyfriend is only at my apartment 1-2 nights max a week. I am deathly allergic to the dogs so yeah i avoid them. AND YES i want my house to be my private getaway...idk why he painted that in a negative tone. My boyfriend was actually relieved, too. Now our talks have switched to us coming together as a couple and figuring out how to save up for a house in 2 years. Which fixed my concern of thinking he only cared about the house first...

Although I gotta vent a bit - I'm bummed that his brother essentially stole this time from him and money as well... He had money for a home before he put it all on this one. Now we have to wait for his brother to pay back his share. Also, he can't be considered on another mortgage until they refinance the house and remove him...in 2 years... I do make a good salary and have excellent credit so I could potentially qualify for a mortgage on my own. We just need to wait, save, and pray that the NY housing market simmers down. It just sucks that his brother has really come in-between him starting his own life. That's how it feels at least. It feels one sided, his brother seemed to call all the shots and now my bf is paying for it. At this point, the issues are financial. His brother is a vet who makes more than double my boyfriend, yet he does not pay most of the mortgage. My boyfriend has been floating most of the mortgage payments, paying for a new roof, etc. He can't pay off his credit cards because of the money tied to paying the roof. They are all essentially in a financial hard spot. 

Overall though - this is excellent news... I'm just glad I won't have to move in there forever. My boyfriend would still like me to move into his apartment soon though for the meantime to help us save up. I'm still on the fence cause I don't like the situation. We were going to do a month trial run of me staying over, see what issues I have, fix them before I move in. Or I just say no entirely and not move in. He is in a financial pinch right now but I don't want to move in based on that alone. Even though it would be temporary - but 2 years is quite a long time. I would rather pay the rent at my place for my own sanity.

&#x200B;

EDIT: I think there is some confusion based on some of the replies I've read - my boyfriend still lives in the house they bought together. He is not being kicked out, he will still live there until me and him were to find a place to call home.  So he is staying there and i'm at staying my apartment still until we make a decision on if i move in with him or vice versa, or if we just stay put where are are. Not rushing that part. so the good about this update is we plan on buying our own home in the future together if all goes well. Him and the brother are trying to work through the issues.

tl;dr Boyfriend and brother decided to separate from the house they bought together. Therefore, me and my boyfriend could buy our own house instead.",True
191,191,"I'm genuinely concerned for my niece but I'm terrified calling the county could result in her being separated from my sister rather than forcing my sister to enroll her in some form of schooling.

My niece has some physical and mental disabilities but is otherwise healthy and happy. My sister had been homeschooling her 6 years ago but silently stopped. She'd be the one to tell us about meeting up with other students at the library, but I've just found out from my niece that that was essentially a lie and my sister also did her schoolwork for her.

What brought this about was my mother had stated I was 28 and she didn't understand the number. My sister then told her ""it's two eight"" for her to know what the word twenty-eight was. I was shocked, saddened, and worried. She's a few weeks away from 15 and doesn't have skills or knowledge that she'll need in only a few years. My sister does not have her GED and scrapes by doing Instacart jobs and living with our mother rent free. 

Do I keep minding my own business or is there a way that I can help my niece without the worst possible scenario occurring? I'm afraid if the county finds out it could be filed under child neglect, because the state of her bedroom is also so bad that the dry wall is peeling from all the mess."," TLDR: long-time group of friends went on big camping trip. Friend who has struggled with alcoholism was a total asshole, made most people either pissed, uncomfortable, cried, or some combo of the 3. As there is a lot of drinking & other drugs on these trips, is there any reasonable way forward with him?

I am a part of a group of friends who loves camping. There are about 30 of us total. We do anything from weekend trips to major ""hike for a day away from civilization and stay there for a week"" trips.

We plan one big week-long trip a year and then smaller groups plan smaller trips throughout the year. Since the pandemic (and everybody getting some out of shape) our big trips have been less strenuous. We're all starting to feel our age more (most of us are in our 40s to 60s), so we've decided as a group to dial it back for the big trips.

The big trips involve packing enough stuff for about a week, and now hiking a few hours out to a more remote location where we don't be disturbed. A fair number of our people love drugs, and part of the experience for them is doing mushrooms in the woods and communing. Others (like myself) stick to a bit of alcohol to enjoy at the end of the day. Some of us bring woods-friendly crafts to sit around a fire and do together. A couple of people looooove to cook, and always bring something to make that is stunningly good over a fire.

This year, one of our people spent literally the entire time drunk, probably often black-out drunk. We have been aware that he struggled with drinking. The people who are closer to him have talked to him about it, both due to past concerning/bad behavior and also out of general love and concern. He actually told a few people that he quit drinking earlier this year because he knew he had a problem.

And it is true that we did not see him obviously drinking. He never had a beer or accepted a spiked hot cocoa, and yet, he seemed constantly fucked up. So one of his closest friends went through his stuff when he was passed out (yes, I know, this was not OK behavior) and found a bunch of bottles of everclear hidden away in his stuff.

I think there was a less than 2 day period during this week+ trip that he wasn't drunk and shitty in one way or another. If he wasn't falling down drunk, he was ""joking"" with people by being mean. He caused 2 people to cry with his ""jokes"" (nobody knew about the 1st time, but after the 2nd time a few people, myself included, told him to knock it the fuck off or leave). When he wasn't joking, he was having weird, inappropriate conversations with people, like brining up his sex life or their sex lives in random, uncomfortable ways. When that wasn't happening, he was unresponsive. Not in a like, incoherently drunk way, he would sit glaring into the fire and if someone tried to talk to him, ask how he was doing/what's up, he would loudly say ""OBVIOUSLY I DON'T WANT TO TALK TO ANYBODY RIGHT NOW"" and continue to sit and glare and then eventually stomp off to his tent.

He had to leave early, and everybody was so glad he did, as the remaining weekend of the trip was a million times better without him.

After we got back to civilization, I wrote him an email about how shitty and unacceptable his behavior was. A few other people did too. We basically told him that as of now, we (anybody who wrote the email) have zero interest in camping with him again until he gets his shit together. Someone else ended up putting together a WhatsApp convo that was basically everybody on the trip except for him, and NOBODY wants to have any trips with him again until he gets his alcoholism under control and improves his behavior.

I'm probably going to be the person to talk to him about this, as I do handle a fair number of the interpersonal conflicts on the rare occasions that they crop up.

But here's the thing: let's say he says he gets sober - there really is no way to know for sure, right? Is it reasonable we demand he get into a program before we let him rejoin us? What about other drugs? Some of our people smoke pot and do mushrooms, and he does both of those things, though his behavior on them hasn't been problematic; it seems the alcohol is the problem.

Even if he did get into a program, is going on a camping trip as a sober person with a bunch of other people who plan to do drugs and/or drink a smart idea? Is there any reasonable way forward with this? To be clear, everybody else seems to have a healthy relationship with drinking/drugs. The rest of our people range from those who don't drink/do any drugs, to those who drunk/smoke pot/do mushreooms/etc at a moderate rate. Nobody likes to or tries to get deliberately fucked up and the rest of the group uses these things as mood enhancers or as a way to relax a bit more vs like going on a heavy duty mushroom trip where you don't even know what reality is anymore, for instance.

I would love especially to hear from people who are in recovery if there is any advice on how to handle this. If we cut him off from these trips entirely, I believe it would be fairly devastating to him. But we cannot have a repeat of the shit he pulled on this last trip. By day 2, everybody was walking on eggshells because of his erratic and shitty behavior.

We want to do the ""right"" thing here, but we don't know what that is. I know there probably is no one right way, but any advice on a good direction would be great!",True
192,192,Hello everyone my name is Ryan I’m 30 years old. Two weeks ago on a Friday my wife Dakota was on her way home from work and was struck head on and killed by a drunk driver that ran a red light she was 32 years old. We had been together since high school when I was 14 and she was 16 and we got married when I was 25 and she was 27 I loved her more than anything. Since then I’ve been spiraling I just can’t comprehend that she’s gone and I’m never going to be able to hear her voice or hold her hand or snuggle up next to her at night. I haven’t been sleeping very well at all I just don’t feel right without her snuggled up next to me. Last Sunday I went to my younger sister Lauren’s house to stay with her because I can’t handle being alone anymore right now she’s 28. I’ve been staying with her for a little over a week now and last Wednesday my father came over to pick something up from her house. My father and I have never really gotten along I’m kinda soft and I’ve always been closer to the women in my family mainly my sister and he’s always hated me for that and made fun of me. Anyway he came in to pickup whatever he was getting and he saw me sitting on the couch with my head on my sisters shoulder crying. He then started laughing at me and told me that I was acting like a weak little baby and that I needed to be a man. My sister told him to fuck off and get out and he did but not without laughing and calling me a baby one more time. Am I really that weak for that I don’t think I am but what do you guys think.,"TL/DR: Religious, Asian mom found condoms. She’s fine with me (21F) still being in a relationship with my boyfriend (21M), but with conditions on the nature of our sexual relationship. Boyfriend is uncomfortable around mom. Not sure how to bridge the gap. What should I do?

A lot has gone down, and I honestly just need to hear some advice about how to proceed. :( This is my first Reddit post, and idk how long these can be, but y’all need to know the whole story because it’s fucked up LOL. I’ve been dating my boyfriend for nearly 7 months now. For context, I still live with my mom and I am financially dependent on her due to college. Boyfriend works & lives alone with roommates.

So back in mid-June, my mom used my car (without asking) to pick up my younger brother & a couple of his friends to drop them off at the mall. When she came home, she threw my bag at me (which I left in the car from the previous night), and told me to explain to her why I had condoms. She was fuming. She found them snooping through my bag, and yelled at me like hell. She cried and screamed at me for “giving yourself up so easily” and called me indecent. Mom is religious and Asian, so you can imagine how that dynamic plays into it. She believes in waiting until marriage for penetrative sex specifically, so this reaction was expected I guess. She then started demanding to know when we started having sex. I couldn’t bring myself to tell her we’ve been intimate together pretty much since our third date, so I just lied and told her we had been having sex since late March. She blew up and refused to even look at me after berating me and telling me I’m throwing my life away and everything she’s worked for. She kept muttering things like “you’re never seeing him again” or “how could he do this to you.” She said I have never disrespected her like this before.

I highly respect and love my mom, so all of this was difficult to take in. I hate that she found out this way, and the guilt still eats me alive, but I do have several gripes. First of all, mom invaded my privacy by taking my car and going through my bags for no reason, but I had no time to process this because of everything else going on. Secondly, she was telling me that I’m being reckless with my body and my life, but she found CONDOMS, meaning my boyfriend and I were actively practicing safer sex. Thirdly, she was assuming that my boyfriend was forcing himself on me, as if I didn’t have a say in the matter and he was “tainting” me. I kept trying to tell her that he wasn’t forcing himself on me, and everything that had happened between us was consensual, but she wouldn’t have it. And finally, she still views me as a child. I understand that I still rely on her financially, and she won’t let me get a job because she wants to provide for my entire college career (it’s complicated). But I’m not dumb. I’m an incoming senior in college, and I’ve maintained a strict 4.0. I rarely party, I never drink, don’t do drugs. I’m good with money, never stay out past midnight. She sets ridiculously high standards for me, and I’ve been on top of them my whole life. As a 21 year old, why can’t I just have this one thing with my boyfriend without her putting me down and saying I’m irresponsible? Haven’t I proven that I’m smart enough to know what I’m doing? 

Anyway, she refused to look at me or speak to me for 3 whole days after the initial confrontation. I explained what was happening to my boyfriend over the phone, and was basically having mental breakdowns every day. Boyfriend assured me that he wasn’t going to leave me and wanted to work things out with me. At this point, my boyfriend and I had been dating for about 5 months. My mom has known about our relationship from the beginning, and was very open and welcoming initially. I had him meet her and we’ve all hung out several times; all of their interactions were positive. I was pretty close with my mom, so I shared a lot of things about him and our relationship with her, but obviously I never shared the sexual aspect of it. After 3 days of no contact with mom, I decided to write her a letter defending myself and my relationship, as well as letting her know that I deeply love and respect her opinions, but I was not asking her permission to stay in the relationship because that’s my decision to make. Mom took another day after reading the letter to finally speak to me. She once again yelled at me, telling me that “his penis should never be inside you, not until you’re married” and that “if you get those urges, you should just touch each other.”

I was absolutely appalled that she thought she could place conditions on what my boyfriend and I do intimately. So even though my mom was explaining to me that she wants my boyfriend and I to work out (albeit with her insane proposed conditions on our sex life), I had to bite my tongue and just cry in private. I did not want to stop having sex with my boyfriend simply because my mom thinks she can control us. That isn’t fair to my wishes or to his. I told my boyfriend everything my mom said to me, and he was upset of course. He said he’s seriously uncomfortable with how my mom treats me like a child and how she involved herself in our sex life.

Fast forward to 2 months later (present time), my mom has not seen boyfriend since this whole situation began. I have still being going on dates with boyfriend, but not bringing him around her. I finally wanted to slowly break the ice and invite him over to my apartment to bake cupcakes with me and watch a show or something. My mom would be home, but I assured him I’d get her to just stay in her room while we hung out. My boyfriend texted saying he was down, but in his words he said he doesn’t “really want to interact with her at all though so if she comes out I’m running LOL🏃🏻‍♀️.” I’m sure he meant that in a funny way, but it actually really hurt to read and I couldn’t respond. It finally hit me that my boyfriend is uncomfortable with the thought of even seeing my mom. That broke my heart because the last thing I wanted was for him to feel unwelcome in my family. I really don’t know what to do. I feel like I’m at a stand still. I’ve been trying my best to set more boundaries with my mom, but it’s so hard. I want my mom and my boyfriend to get along, or at least be civil, but I absolutely don’t want to force my boyfriend to talk to her when I know he’s opposed to it. I wish I had been more careful about hiding the condoms. Now my mom is more protective than ever. I hate this so much. I love my boyfriend, I love my mom, and I just want it to work out, but I don’t know how to bridge the gap.

Does anyone have any advice about what I should do? 😭",True
193,193,"So…good god I honestly have no idea where to start with this one.

So I’m 26 and female and earlier this year, my mother adopted an autistic son (15) and he’s such a precious human being. He’s just a ray of hope and happiness and radiates it everywhere he goes, and I’m so lucky to be his big sister. However, he doesn’t really have any friends at all and I really wanted him to have someone he could hang out with and have fun, so I asked my fiancé if he could take him out on a guys day, and he obliged. On Saturday, my brother, my fiancé, and my fiancé’s best friend all went to the movie theater.

Now from what I’ve heard, this is what happened: my brother said he was worried he’d have to go to the bathroom during the movie because he drank a lot of soda at lunch, and my fiancé and his best friend jokingly said he should just pee on the floor because “it’s much more convenient and you’re actually helping the theater staff by giving them stuff to do.” They we’re obviously just being stupid and joking around, but my brother didn’t realize that. So in the middle of the movie, he got on his knees and pulled the front of his shorts down and…well you get it. (he said there wasn’t anyone around them and no one saw so at least there’s that)

They both felt horrible and after they brought him home and told me what happened. I was really annoyed with them and I sat down with my brother and asked him about it and tactfully explained how that behavior is abhorrent and antisocial and should never be repeated. He felt insanely stupid and got so embarrassed he started crying, and as a result he’s refused to talk to my fiancé or even really leave the house for non school related things.

My brother feels like an idiot and is too embarrassed to leave the house, my fiancé and his best friend feel absolutely terrible, and I’m annoyed, upset, and feel bad. What the hell can even be done at this point?

Tl;dr: my fiancé jokingly suggested to my autistic brother than he should pee on the floor of the movie theater and he didn’t realize my fiancé was joking so he actually peed on the floor of the theater, and now my fiancé feels terrible and my brother is too embarrassed to leave the house.

EDIT: it wasn’t an accident on both sides. I fully admit this was entirely because of my fiancé and his best friend, but what I was trying to say is that they’re not bad people. They 100% didn’t realize he would take them seriously and were just trying to make a dopey joke and treat him like one of the guys. I know that doesn’t excuse their behavior, but just because they did a shitty thing doesn’t mean they’re shitty people.

Also, my fiancé wanted to talk to him in person to apologize but my brother doesn’t want anything to do with him. Now he’s writing him a letter that I’ll give my brother if he wants to read it. My fiancé also bought books off Amazon about autism and the behaviors of those on the spectrum to hopefully develop a connection with him in the future.

EDIT 2: I absolutely didn’t use those exact words when telling my brother his actions weren’t correct, I was just using them to convey the sentiment of what I told him. I very gently told him that going to the bathroom is something we need to do in private and it’s not seem as normal or acceptable to do it in a public setting. Then after I hugged him and told him it was ok and that he just misunderstood and he wasn’t stupid.","Original: [https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/w2rgsu/friend\_fallen\_into\_toxic\_victimhood\_how\_to\_help/](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/w2rgsu/friend_fallen_into_toxic_victimhood_how_to_help/)\*\*Mention of death

5 days after the post: We went with the cafe setting outside, in public, thinking it would help because Gus hates being the center of attention. HA. Hubs and I rehearsed our points, and talked about what we would do if this or that happened (Lots of WTF and thinking back and feeling stupid, but it's life and we're only human).

We get directed to the table and order, and I go use the bathroom, and pay inside with the cashier/hostess/server gal and let her know that we won't need any refills or extras (just 3 coffees), that we're going to sit there about 10min and walk off with our napkin trash. I come back and Hubs gives me the look that says go time. We're walking away, and when Gus brings up work and how I've had to move our HazMat center and made his life a hell, Hubs went on the offensive and interrupted Gus. Hubs told him how he can't handle hearing about how everyone else in the world has made Gus's life miserable, that when he speaks the only things that have come out these past moons have been hateful negativity and he just can't take it anymore. Gus asked for examples, and we took turns bringing one up and then backing the other up with those points. Gus stopped us and said he thought we were all friends. I asked him if he remembered the last conversation we really had about anything other than his woes, and he couldn't. Hubs asked Gus if he remembered when Hubs was talking to Gus about our family-member passing away in a brutal manner earlier this year, Gus told us (verbatim),""Oh yeah, I remember when my family-member died, it wasn't that big a deal,"" and then talked about his own parents. We told him its been so long since he's been friendly with us, we've forgotten when it was.

I was good and riled by this point, and Gus asked what we expected, we told him we can't be his friends anymore, and it feels like we were let go a long time ago, but all he's done is stab me in the back and try to twist. I told him I ""know everything about what you've tried to do to me at work, and I know everything that you've told to X, X, X, X, and X."" We had rounded back to where he parked, and just walked off.

We decided to park a ways away so it was a good 1mi walk to our car on purpose, and that's when he started calling our phones. Gus followed us from a small distance as we speed-walked away, and went between whine-shouting, calling and yelling, and then finally he started to sound like he was sobbing, but we just kept walking away as fast as we could without looking like lunatics. Finally we got to the car, and we go home. That felt like hours because I was mortified, but we never even looked back at him and kept straight faced talking about it as we walked. I have no idea how far he followed us.

Then my superior calls about 3hr later, and ""Someone"" is filing harassment claims at work against me with such wording, that HR came out of their offices and they asked me to come in outside of my work schedule. I went, clocked in, and was asked to open up my work email on 3 computers. They read all kinds of documents I keep, all the correspondence in my dept. separated folders, TEAMS, emails to record retention that I had Gus-Orange coded, everything I've ever sent that had Gus or Gus accessories attached to it. I could clearly see they only went to Gus-Orange. It took over an hour, and they asked me to keep these logged in. My superior told me I could go home, and just come back on my next work day. HR was actually super pleasant about everything. I just acted like it was any other day with my cheery work-self, but inside I am a seething ball of piss and vinegar and rage. I'm not stupid enough to (re)act to it, and just kindof smile and say goodbye to everyone and go.

I told Hubs the basics, and we went on a tangent together about it. Once our collective outrage had simmered off and we got back to rational discussions, it was just relief. It's done, and HR and superior know I have nothing to hide, so why let it suck my energy and happiness. Now I'm just thanking myself for not cleaning out anything and over-communicating to my superior. No word came from Gus after that first day, and when I go in his shift is leaving with a 30min layover. I haven't seen him in days and it's been pretty great.

TL;DR: Ex-friend was explained to, went through the stages of grief in public while we mom-walked away, called HR on me same day, and we have nothing but relief and quiet now.

Edited for answers because that's a lot:-Managers at my company do not promote others, HR does. I got told after the fact and had to deal with who I got.-My team tried to just work around Gus without telling me til afterward (first post) because they're very nice people who (ironically) also thought helping on the side was enough.-Gus's boss is my boss ""superior,"" and they also didn't promote Gus, just HR.-HR asked me to open the emails on three computers probably as a guilt test to see how I'd react, but I had nothing to hide and everything to show! Why be bothered? Gus can't touch me professionally, and everything he did was documented, on camera, and HR does a great job at keeping things quiet (for better or worse). He has already been called into ""THE office"" several times in July, and it's really obvious now that shit is going down.-Why didn't we record it for youtube? *Seriously?*\-Why didn't I report what I found; Where I work there are a lot of checks and balances on what my team oversees. After we stamp the digital product and file the dead trees, the paper is locked away and the files are sitting there for certain other departments to check over. It's important enough that it's reviewed three more times before getting finalized. Superior, Accounting, HR and Admin are the last ones to touch it. Guess who sees the report tampering and who logged in, who has camera access, and who knows who is clocked in when and where? That's why I'm not concerned.

\-Why aren't I more mad? I'm fucking fuming.--The little mf'er thinks he can play me and get away with it? No! Would I be fired for retaliation and have a record somewhere I love to work and have an awesome position? Maybe, and he isn't worth my revenge because I wouldn't thrive in jail/prison/whatever. I grew up a lonely, bitter, angry little nerd and staying all-the-time pissed does no one any good. We have fewer saplings and need less wood during bon fire season, and that's healthier than going on a warpath that would lead to destruction.--Everyone who messaged me about getting even can do as they please, I'm going to cope with my residual anger and this heavy relief of a mental burden and live my life without giving more emotion to the little shit.  


Edited update 24 days later;  
About a week after this post, Gus ended up quitting weirdly. He closed the location early (sent home his crew who got paid regardless, so that lil revenge he had was moot), and drove around the parking lot (few hours) until Big Boss came in, they had a weird chat, and then Gus hopped into his truck, blazed out of the parking lot into the grass, ran massive tire bumps and trails in the grass/dirt, and drove off into the sunrise. He was banned from all the company's property with the police and everything.  


After that, I train two new managers, retrain Gus's old crew, and finally go back to normal schedule after having weird nights/days/mids schedule these past two weeks.   
Gus did this, in order from ;  
\-Call my Hubs and left him a lot voicemails, most of which asked when he is divorcing me (PPPBBTTT, and Hubs didn't reply)  
\-Facebook messaged my sister asking if she knew I was suicidal (yeah,no)  
\-Sent his mom to the grocery store to pick up something, where we ran into her and politely nodded/smiled and kept going when she waved us over. She tried to talk to us but we're faster walkers (I'm not getting mixed up with any of that bloodline)  
\-Prank called my workplace like... asking for Seymor Butts, pretending to be a vendor or repairman (my dept. oversees all third party) and tried to talk to me. I hung up on that moron.  
\-And then, we see his house is for sale on [Realtor.com](https://Realtor.com). Wow... so randomly quitting your job and then not having one had a consequence.   
\-I start getting calls from other businesses because Gus put ME down as a reference. I let them know they can speak to Supervisor at Work, because, ""I am not comfortable discussing his employment or behavior without both HR and Legal being part of the discussion.""

People at work have started coming to me to talk about some of the things Gus said about me to them after he quit with us. I told them it wasn't important to me, and it doesn't affect me (they don't need to know I'm trying to let this rage pass through me quietly), but if they felt it would help them I would happy to listen. Supervisor told me we've hired back the people who were wronged, and gave them a good bump. I suggested to HR that Supervisor's level needs to be in on interviews, at the very least, to prevent something like this happening again. I was honest with them about what I thought of Gus, and a lot of the things he said to/about/around people and the company, and suggested that I'd be happy to calculate the lost money from labor, personnel, hiring, and orientation he caused to report to Supervisor and Big Boss if it would help. After all, we're all here to make a dollar, yeah?  


And now, I have no idea what's going on with Gus. I haven't seen him or heard his voice in a week, because I asked IT to block his number after reporting it. Hubs hasn't gotten any messages in a week. We're just living our best life, riding the blessed silence left in Gus's wake. ",True
194,194,"My bf over the last 6 months has increasingly got into enjoying it when his friends see me in underwear or short skirts/low cut tops which didn’t bother me but more recently wants me to let him send them more revealing photos or find ways to have me nude in front of them, strip poker, walking out the shower ect.

Is this something that guys are into or anyone has experienced? Not sure how common this is or if I should get rid of him.","Exactly like the title says. I (30F) have two best friends who are engaged (31F and 29M) we’ll call them Meg and Ryan for the sake of the story. 

Meg is away for a business trip so Ryan and I decided to go to the local watering hole for some day drinks. Nothing big, just to get out of the house. Us going out was NOT the issue (like I said; we’re all best friends) it was what happened next that blew up the situation. 

I had sent her a little update pic of him with a funny caption along the lines of “I haven’t lost your finance yet!” And her immediate response was asking why he wasn’t responding to her. I didn’t know why so I said I’d give him grief about it. It quickly turns to her sending us both extremely mean messages because he’s left her dogs alone for too long (they’re not bad dogs, simply elderly) and that I need to send him home ASAP. I tell her hey idk what arrangement they have going on regarding the dogs and not to be mad at me. He’s grown and I can’t make him leave an establishment. 

When Meg is upset, it immediately turns into accusations, extreme insults and spam messages and calls. I chose not to respond to the majority of it simply because I don’t do well with someone yelling at me, I shut down. I told her it wasn’t my fault and that was met with accusations of betrayal (you don’t care about my dogs or me, you’re a terrible person etc). I decided to make my way home and let them deal with their issues. She relentlessly sent me extreme messages and would not stop calling me. I left my phone in another room because I couldn’t explain myself again. She said that she had checked her cameras at home and he wasn’t there so I MUST be lying. I reiterated that idk where he is and that I was home and no longer involving myself in their personal issues. She’s since blocked me, not before sending us both a message about how she’s kicking him out and he can come stay with me. 

The advice I’m looking for is how to salvage the friendship without letting her off the hook for being verbally abusive? I am terrible with words and have a tough time sticking up for myself. But the things she said were out of line. 

TL;DR my (30F) best friend (31F) was extremely verbally abusive to me because her finance was out later than she approved him to be.",True
195,195,"My boyfriend of 7 months just confronted me because he found two dildos and a vibrator inside a dresser drawer in my room. I almost cried because I was so embarrassed, and I’ve told him multiple times not to go through my things. He said that I’m selfish and disgusting for using sex toys, and that I’m basically cheating on him. He said that I either have to throw them away, or he’s gonna break up with me. What should I do?







UPDATE: This morning my bf called me at around 8am and apologized for everything he said, and promised things would be better in the future.(he cash app me 70 bucks idk why). I cursed him out a bit then told him that he embarrassed me and really hurt my feelings, and that I want to take a break from the relationship for now to think sum things over. Did I make the right decision?
Let me know.
Thank you all SM for all of the great advice, and support❤️❤️!!","I work long days sometimes 12 hours+ including the commute and I have to be up at 6. My BF works 8hours and we live right by his work. He doesn't get up until half 8. He doesn't want to move.

Every night when I get home we take it in turns to cook the tea. We spend most nights together and talk a lot every evening about our day etc. Then we zone out and watch TV but still talking a bit. I like to be in bed by 10 as it takes me a while to fall asleep due to my busy day. He goes about 12. I've told him when I'm tired I need to go to bed and not force myself to stay up longer. 

My issue is every time I say I'm going to bed he THEN decides to start telling me a story, sometimes following me into the bedroom to carry it on. He also does this if I'm going out to meet a friend or if my friend/family member is picking me up. He will wait until it's exactly the time I need to leave, or get the text saying they're outside, and start telling me something then. He gets offended when I cut him off and ask him to tell me the rest later.

I've asked him time and time again to please not do this. Even going as far as to say ""I'm going to bed in half hour, if you need to tell me a story or something please do it now."" He will still remember something right before. He also goes to the bathroom the second I say I'm going to bed, and takes like 10 mins so I have to wait to brush my teeth, but I've started going before saying it so that's not an issue now.

It's stressing me out that he won't listen. I feel like he's trying to get me to prove he is more important than my time or sleep or other people, and taking advantage of the fact I'm a polite person.

What do you think?

196,196,"I (19F) just found out my sister (23F) (let’s call her Susan) gave my name to the police when she was caught shoplifting.

On December 23rd her father texted me on messenger asking for my social security number because Susan was in trouble and would go back to jail if she didn’t get it. Well I refused to give it and I thought that was that. Well I asked Susan what it was about and she told me it was nothing. 

She used my name when she had gotten into a car accident a few months ago because she had a warrant out for her arrest and I’m still dealing with hospital bills. 

Today, I’ve been getting a bunch of letters from attorneys wanting to represent me. I didn’t even know I had court on January 9th, which means Susan was going to let me miss my court date, get a warrant for my arrest and not care.

I was at working for 12 hours on the 23rd and I work damn near 2 hours away from when she was caught stealing from. 

I guess, I’m asking how do I go about this? Do I let her know that I know I have court? Do I bring my time slip from work that day? Will it stay on my record? Do I go to her court date on February 9th and bring that up?","**TL;DR - Currently in an argument with my GF about how much time together is right. I told her that the fact that we do basically everything together might be a contributing factor to our fighting more recently and she was very offended by that.**

My GF and I have been fighting a lot lately. I suggested maybe the fact that we see each other basically all the time aside from the time we're at work could be a contributing factor and some time here and there where we do our own things and miss each other might be healthy.

She responded with ""I keep ignoring the signs you give me that you're not invested in this like I am."" We ended up having a long argument and going to sleep. In that argument she mentioned that now she has to tip toe around coming to my apartment because now she doesn't know when I want to hang out and when I don't.

This morning I tried to talk to her again to clarify and I told her basically that ""I don't mean I don't want to see you and I like that you have access to my apartment and come and go as you please. The times when you tell me you're going over to my place before I'm home from work makes me really happy because I like that you're comfortable here even if I'm not around"" to maybe make her feel a little better.

When we revisit this topic later, I want to basically go back and tell her ""all I mean is that it's okay if we're both at my apartment doing separate activities sometimes too since we do all of our social activities together"" but I didn't want to mention it this morning because I would think it would warrant a longer discussion to be had after and it was right before work so I didn't think it was the time to have that discussion.

Any advice on how this problem in relationships should be approached from those of you who have been through this? I love my girlfriend a lot.

197,197,"I am not asking for professional interviewer advice. I need human advice on this. 

&#x200B;

As I write this I am about 600 CVs (curriculum vitae/application) deep, I am tired, and I want to go to bed. I'm a mum of two, I refuse to let my job keep me from having a life with my kids, but this process is doing that anyway. I have a long day of reading CVs tomorrow. 

&#x200B;

We are interviewing for a high paid and very important position at our company, think 6 figures and the first number isnt 1. We are getting people from across the globe applying here and my team and I have a mountain of these to get through.

&#x200B;

This person was about to go on the very top of my pile for final interview. She is 1 of only 2 I have seen so far who I was about to put forward for what is I am pretty sure the chance of a lifetime for many engineers. I got to her experience and everything is great, she even got hired by a company we actively engage with, that is her most recent position. This is a major check mark next to her name. I could not ask for better.

&#x200B;

But she has listed her position as a ""Femgineer"". I did the right thing, I called them to make absolutely sure, and I checked online. That was not her or anybody's job title ever. What she wrote under it is at least pretty well worded and gives the right information, but this sticks out like a sore thumb pretty majorly.

&#x200B;

This lack of professionality has me stunned. I have never seen someone applying for a job at this level do something like this unless it was a joke within the office.

&#x200B;

I get it. She is in a very male oriented role. She is trying to elbow her way into this role in life and push men aside at every turn and carve a little female space out of an ocean of masculinity. She is 1 of maybe 5 women who have applied to this job period as far as I know.

&#x200B;

This is not a small family shop she's applying to. I have never met this woman before. It's not like she came in, got to know me before applying, or I knew her previously and then threw that in as a nice little inside joke between us. This is her actual CV for the actual job.

&#x200B;

Her responsibility here would be massive, she would more or less make or break our project, and this position would make or break her career no doubt. She must be aware of this. Despite all that, she felt it necessary to call herself a ""Femgineer"".

&#x200B;

She aced the previous two interviews. She has a 10/10, 5 points from both. However this is pretty staggering. This is the kind of thing a 23 year old fresh out of college/university would put on a CV when applying to a trendy video game company. We are not that.

&#x200B;

Right now, her CV is in the bin, along with just under 600 others. I was genuinely concerned by her extreme lack of professionality for such a high level and important position. AITA for throwing her CV out for calling herself a ""Femgineer""? Should I give her a chance at the final interview or not?","So me and my gf have been dating for a year and a half now. In just under a year from now, she and her family plan to go on a vacation and she wants me to come. I would honestly love to go but there are a few issues. 

I live alone in my own place and make just enough to keep my head above water. I am very frugal and like to save money. I save it for retirement as well as investing so I can make more money to keep myself afloat. I certainly have the funds but I am not the type to blow it all on a vacation. I prefer to spend extra money on nice dinners occasionally or a movie out. The little things. It costs around 2 grand for just me alone to go. I’m also introverted and am not a big fan of crowds or loud noises. 

My gf doesn’t like to save money but plans to do so for the trip.  She believes in the idea of if you got money you should spend it because yolo and money for memories is important to her. She lives with her family and is able to save up money for the vacation. She also keeps trying to convince me and wants me to just use up what she calls a tiny portion of my hard earned savings to go with her. She and her family are travelers, they love traveling and going places. I am not. 

I love this girl and I’d love to go. But I’m forced to recognize we have different values and goals in life and I’m not starting to wonder if we are truly right for each other. I think I should go both because I’d like to and it would be good for our relationship but I’m worried what might happen between then and now, such as us breaking up. Any advice would be helpful. 

Edit: I forgot to mention the main reason I’m concerned is that I have to pay the amount in advance. Like within the next week. Which is what has me concerned in case we break up or god knows what happens between now and the nearly a year later to then.

198,198,"My (20F) dad (60) masturbates almost daily in the shared living room. He stays up to like 4 am watching TV shows and then he changes it to porn. At night he watches it either on mute or very quietly. I know this because unfortunately I saw it a few times when I was younger. My room is upstairs but the living room and the kitchen are downstairs, so because I have trouble sleeping I went to the kitchen to grab some water or food, so I saw that. But he quickly turns it off when he hears me walking. So for the past like 7 years whenever I have to go downstairs to the kitchen after midnight I try to make as much sound as possible before going there so that he will hear me and be able to turn off porn if he is watching it, because the kitchen and the living room are like a one room seperated by the dining table.

The solution to this part of the problem would be to bring food and water to my room so I don't have to go downstairs at night right? Well I tried that so many times over the years but then my mom gets mad at me for having food in my room. The same is for water, we usually buy big water bottles of 5 liters so I can't just take it to my room because everyone pours themselves a glass of water from there. I was never able to explain the reason to her why I bring food and water to my room.

But the bigger problem is that he watches porn very loudly during the day. Sometimes at 11 am, sometimes at 2 pm. Whenever he thinks I'm not home or that I'm sleeping, he just starts to watch it. So when I want to have breakfast or lunch, or just go to the bathroom, or leave the house, I have to be very careful and make loud noices so that he would hear that I'm home and that I will go downstairs to the kitchen. But that's too late because when I open the door of my room, I have already heard loud porn. Then he turns it off and switches to random TV show and puts that very loud to cover up that he was watching porn. Then after I got lunch from the kithcen, I take it to my room and eat alone because I can't eat in the kitchen, and when I go back to my room, he turns the TV show off and continues to watch porn, so I'm stuck in my room with the dishes until my mom gets home from work and then gets mad at me for having lunch and leaving dishes in my room. Then my dad proceeds to tell her how I never eat in the kitchen because I'm nasty so they both hate on me for not eating in the kitchen, but I can't because my dad watches porn in the same room! Most times he is sitting there naked, which I unfortunately saw a few times too when I was younger because I had no idea what he was doing when I went downstairs to the kitchen.

He has his own computer, tablet, wireless headphones, also has his own room and his bathroom, but he still chooses to watch it loudly in the shared living room.

As I wrote in the title, I don't want to confront him because I think that he is fully aware of what he is doing and even though I unfortunately saw that so many times over the years, he didn't stop doing that and because of his behaviour, there is no point in confronting him about that or anything else, because he will turn it against me, like he does everything else. 

The only way is to talk to my mom about it, but I'm not sure how to tell her that her husband is masturbating daily watching porn loudly while I'm home. What would be the best approach to this? I know that it will be very uncomfortable situation for everyone. Any advice would be appreciated!","Link to original: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/x1pspn/bf_m32_wants_me_f29_and_our_daughter_to_move_back/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share


To the people who commented on my last post, thank you! I will be staying comfortable at my parents home for a while (and they're so excited, haha). I've applied for a program at a local college and I'm going to start building a stable life for myself and my daughter. My goal is to be in my own place just before she starts school in 2025 ❤️

Little update:

He's really been on a downward spiral the last couple of days. Mad that I won't move back sooner than spring (don't worry, I'm not going back at all now), mad that I won't move back and struggle with him to build a life together, mad that he still can't get his video game and collectible this month and I won't move back and start ""contributing to our life together"". 

His entire pay yesterday had to go to rent so he can't get groceries, he can't pay his phone bill, he hasn't sent me money for internet since June, but I'm ""making him suffer"" because I won't move back. I said even if I wanted to, there's no money for moving costs and he said ""I can come up with the money"" so I asked ""If you can come up with that kind of money, don't you think it should be going towards rent, bills, food and stabilizing the home?"" And his response was ""Ok so everything is canceled then. This is what you want. Now look at you turn it around on me again"". Like, WTF? All I asked about was stabilizing the home for the family. How is that a bad thing?

He even tried to say that I wouldn't have to work if I moved back, but clearly he can't even have a stable home on his own. He said ""So we could work together and build a good life over time or we can stay apart while you are comfortable and I am not and what? In 6 months you come back? The same problems will be here in spring.""

He said he was behind on things because of our last visit and then asked if we were still going for the visit we planned for the end of this month so I replied: 
""So we're the reason you have no money? I don't want to be going into a situation with the possibility of eviction, or where all of my things are going to have to go back to sitting in the pawn shop just to barely catch up. All of your pays this month are going to have to go to rent, aren't they? Or am I going to have to keep feeling guilty for putting you behind again?"" And his response was ""We won't get evicted. I'm only behind for 1 week. So you are just going to insult me?""

He's also been saying that I'm ""using his depression as a reason to ignore him"" and that I ""don't want to be with him"" and ""don't want him to be a father"". I'm just ignoring him because I'm tired of fighting and he is determined to prove that I am in the wrong. I would love for him to be a father, but he clearly doesn't have his priorities straight in order to be a good father.

Anyway, I have my own goals now and I plan on achieving them. Thanks again!

They work together so a clean break isn't possible, though he says they haven't been talking or spending time together outside of any professional capacity for a few weeks.

I know that developing crushes while in relationships is normal and that since nothing happened I can't be too upset, but I am still having a really hard time.

Rising interest rates will only make the issue worse as the only people who can buy will be cash buyers and corporations. They’ll get the deal of a lifetime and force many of us to rent indefinitely.

I believe we should ban corporations from buying single family homes unless they’re buying the homes to tear them down and build multiple apartments (increasing overall housing supply). 

New sales should be halted immediately and existing homes would have to be sold or redeveloped over time to avoid tanking the market immediately.

EDIT: Adding a bit of clarification so I don’t keep repeating myself:

Managing a supply of single family homes for rental could be handled with a permitting process like Airbnb’s in some metropolitan areas.

If you want to rent out a home you own, you need a permit with a cap on how many can be given out. If you can’t get a permit, either sell the property to someone who wants it as their primary residence or redevelop it into a multi-tenant building.

The permitting process could favor individuals with only 1-2 properties over landlords with dozens / hundreds.

This would obviously drive down housing prices but that’s the point — if someone has the means to own their own home they shouldn’t have to outbid Blackrock or their town’s landlord to do it.","['T1 Faker on his team\'s play in the LCK Spring Split playoffs: ""Our play in the playoffs was really sloppy.

102,102,"Alopecia is a medical condition but it is not a disability. A disability in my view is a condition or set of symptoms that limits how someone physically moves around in the world, or interpersonally interacts with the world. Jokes about disabilities in general are ableist because it belittles the extra efforts people with disabilities make to adapt in a world that is designed for ‘able’ people. 

But alopecia is just hair loss. It doesn’t physically restrict someone from moving through the world or limit how they interact with others. 

I accept that alopecia can cause depression and anxiety etc which if severe enough can constitute a disability. But that’s depression/anxiety, not alopecia. Calling alopecia a disability is a smack in the face for other people with legitimate disabilities. 

If we’re saying it is a disability, why is male pattern baldness not considered a disability, or psoriasis, eczema etc? 

I don’t understand the undercurrent of commentary only that basically says that Chris Rock made an ableist joke and deserves to get socked in the face for. Was the joke tasteless? Yeah. Was it ableist? No.

ETA: it’s difficult to respond to each and everyone’s comments so I’ll summarise my take here. 

I have a better understanding now of what alopecia can entail and how it can impact someone’s day to day life. I still find it difficult to accept it as a disability because most people are focusing on the aesthetic aspect of alopecia (ie bald women are treated differently than those with hair, harder for them to participate in certain industries like acting, fashion etc - which I think the same can be said for people of certain ethnicities or people not being conventionally beautiful). 

I appreciate the varied experiences that have been shared showing that some medical conditions can be to an extent that it can be disabling. It’s made me think that my original criteria for what a disability is might be too restrictive. 

I don’t think my mind has been changed regarding alopecia specifically and the ableist nature of the joke, but I have a better understanding of disabilities as a whole now.","['of any sentries ON the other side of the river.\n\nThe Maiden of the Mist is confident in her stealth and ability to avoid being seen.

What I'm talking about here is circumcision for religious or cultural reasons, or circumcision in order to prevent any problems that may happen in the future. 

Firstly, religious reasons. In cases where a man is circumcised for religious purposes, it should be left until the man is at the age of medical consent (in my country 16). Doing it to a child who can't consent, and who may not even decide to follow your religion is wrong, and should be seen in the same way that fgm is seen.

Secondly, for hygiene reasons. One of the biggest arguments I've seen on here for circumcision is that an intact penis is more susceptible to infections. If the child is taught to clean it properly, then there really won't be any problems. I've had a foreskin my whole life, and I've never had any problems with genital hygiene, it's really not complicated.

**My view:**

There are many passionate fans of high school sports. There are also many students who love performing arts and other creative activities. Both have value and are unquestionably a net positive for students. School sports cost drastically more than arts programs do, yet it seems to always be art on the chopping block. 

1. **Art programs are more beneficial to one's career than sports programs are.**

Growing studies have shown that arts education makes people better in a wide variety of career fields. [https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-00334-2](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-00334-2); [https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s42330-019-00057-7](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s42330-019-00057-7)  For this reason, the acronym STEM (science, technology, engineering and math) has been expanded to STEAM, adding arts. A few studies have linked sports participation to greater academic achievement, but there has been comparatively scant research to examine the question. [https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/full/10.1086/693117](https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/full/10.1086/693117)  

Skills learned in the arts are often directly transferrable to valuable careers. Public speaking, aesthetics, creativity and problem-solving are direct benefits of the arts. Sports activities increase social cohesion and physical fitness. Both have value, but the first is more relevant to most careers.

   2. **School sports programs lead to bullying, classism and gender conflicts.**

It is a recognized and unsolved problem that student athletes are more prone to bullying than students engaged in other extracurricular activities. [https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2020.02037/full](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2020.02037/full)  Sports parents can be toxic, setting poor examples for students. Currently, large-scale debate over bathrooms and appropriate divisions for transgender high schoolers has erupted. No similar issues are pertinent to extracurricular arts. 

   3. **School sports programs are more expensive.**

School sports programs are extremely expensive. Costs include the stadium, uniforms, equipment and travel expenses to games. (See above sources and also [https://www.nbcnews.com/news/education/hidden-figures-college-students-may-be-paying-thousands-athletic-fees-n1145171](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/education/hidden-figures-college-students-may-be-paying-thousands-athletic-fees-n1145171)). Arts programs do not cost nearly as much, comparatively. They use facilities already located at the school. The materials for arts classes are much cheaper. Yet, we cut them first. That makes zero sense to me.

   4. **Cutting arts programs without cutting sports is both misogynistic and homophobic.**

Common stereotypes indicate that girls and gay high schoolers are more likely to participate in performing arts and other arts than straight boys are. To my mind, given the domination of the straight male in American politics, these programs are being supported more broadly because these programs appeal to those in power.

   5. **The costs of school sports are not always offset.**

It is commonly argued in these debates that college football is profitable. Certainly, that is the case for large, popular universities. That is not the case for your average, small liberal arts college. [https://www.air.org/sites/default/files/downloads/report/Academic-Spending-vs-Athletic-Spending.pdf](https://www.air.org/sites/default/files/downloads/report/Academic-Spending-vs-Athletic-Spending.pdf) For high schools, obviously very little money is raised.

   6. **School sports can operate much more cheaply than it does.**

School sports are expensive because schools have placed an emphasis on winning rather than on simply providing a positive outlet for kids to exercise and have fun. There is no reason for high school sports programs to take on semi-professional status. By advancing intramural sports, schools could cut costs, allow more kids to participate, and reduce much of the bullying from other students and parents. This would preserve the positive effects of school sports while ameliorating the negative effects.","[""Planned Parenthood is under fire for violating HIPAA.

Time and time again, videos and records of police interactions that show a clear retaliation due to someone recording their interaction surface. It's ridiculous that by now in 2022, there are still police officers who don't understand that citizens have a legal right to record public officials on duty.

Even if you are not a fan of being recorded, it doesn't change the fact that citizens are legally allowed to record in public, and that no one, including police officers, has a right to privacy on public land. 

Police officers who show a clear retaliation to the act of recording them in public should be removed from duty until they can demonstrate that they understand civilian rights. This could be through mandatory training, some form of reprimand, etc. If they continue to fail at respecting citizens civil rights, then they should be fired without a chance for reinstatement.

In the same sense that it's possible for me, as a person with no medical degree, to help someone. Lots of medical knowledge is available to the public, and Chiropractors can use that information just as well as anyone.

My position is that the practice of  Chiropractic is not based on science, there is no evidence that  Chiropractic treatment helps anyone, and plenty of evidence that ""adjustment"" does harm.

* They're Charlatans
   * The main premise of Chiropractic is treating ""spinal subluxation"" which is well proven to not be a real condition.
   * The founder of Chiropractic Daniel D Palmer has an insane biography including being jailed for medical fraud and practicing medicine without a license.
      * He claimed that spinal subluxation is the sole cause of all medical problems and that Chiropractic was the cure for all medical problems amongst other crazy shit like
      * That he learned about Chiropractic from the ghost of James Atkins
      * ""[nutrition testing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Applied_kinesiology)"" (widely practiced by modern Chiropractors despite a plethora of studies proving it's ""[no better than random guessing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Applied_kinesiology#cite_note-kenney-4)""
      * and [toftness devices](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toftness_device)
   * Even amongst ""mixers"" many of DD Palmers teachings are still widely held
* Chiropractic does harm
   * A [review of spinal injuries during non-surgical spinal manipulation](https://academic.oup.com/ptj/article/79/1/50/2857770)  concluded that >60% of all cases were performed by Chiropractors including 32 deaths.
   * A [2010 literature review concluded](https://doi.org/10.1111%2Fj.1742-1241.2010.02352.x) that there's no evidence to assume neck manipulation helps with *any medical condition* and that the risk of death from such manipulation was significant.
   * A [2009 review](https://doi.org/10.1016%2Fj.ypmed.2009.05.004) evaluating maintenance chiropractic care found that spinal manipulation is associated with considerable harm and no compelling evidence exists to indicate that it adequately prevents symptoms or diseases, thus the risk-benefit is not evidently favorable.
   * They largely position themselves antagonistically to modern medicine, including recommending patients against seeing real doctors and against receiving vaccines, and trying to scare them away from getting help for serious medical conditions

&#x200B;

Edit: I want to be 100% clear that I'm open to being convinced, and what would convince me is any **data and analysis** that Chiropractors have better outcomes than amateurs, that the harm they do is overstated, OR that there's some rigorous scientific backing for their practice. Personal anecdote will not convince me, see my disclaimer at the top.

Edit2: Thanks a lot to everyone for a (mostly) respectful and rigorous discussion of evidence. I'm sincerely sorry for any posts I've missed, this post blew up a lot more than I expected. From the evidence so far

* I've retained my belief that Chiros are mostly running a fraudulent medical practice, and that they do sometimes harm people (and it seems that the biggest issue is poor oversight and a complete lack of scientific rigor.
* My opinion of the harm that Chiros do has actually solidified more after this thread, after learning that up to half of patients report short-term adverse affects from manipulation including increased local/radiating pain.
* **Where I've changed my belief and awarded some deltas** in on the topic of SMT for lower back pain; there is some good evidence that Chiropractic SMT (spinal manipulation therapy) *is effective* for *short term* relief for *some* patients with lower back pain, *though it is not found to be superior to other treatments.* There's also *some controversial evidence* supporting the use of SMT for neck pain and headaches. As far as I can tell, there is no evidence that Chiropractic is effective at supporting any other health problem practitioners claim it can help with, and I haven't seen any evidence in this discussion (do feel free to DM me if I missed something).

The abusive user and post appeared to my username as ‘deleted’ in the period during which I was writing my response, but on logging out, I could see that their abusive post was not deleted and was still publicly viewable.

I then tested a response using another account, but although it’s visible from that account, it’s not publicly viewable.

If you don’t want to read all that here’s the short version of it: In the 90s Pepsi ran a marketing campaign where you would get “Pepsi Points” by buying Pepsi products and you could exchange those points for things such as T-shirts, jackets, sunglasses, backpacks and so on. Pretty standard stuff.

The difference is that the TV ad for this campaign ended with a fighter jet landing and a very unambiguous message that you could exchange 7 million points for the jet, the other, more normal things all cost a few hundred to a couple thousand points, so the jet was by a huge margin the most expensive thing.

The kicker is that the campaign also sold points directly for 10 cents each, so instead of spending however many millions on Pepsi cans you could just pay 700,000 USD for the necessary points to get the jet.

In the end a judge ruled that it wasn’t reasonable to believe that you could actually get a jet from a soda company’s marketing campaign, so the guy who actually got the money together to buy the necessary points didn’t get his jet after all.

I think it’s a gross miscarriage of justice, a jury should have decided wether or not it was “reasonable” or “believable” to expect Pepsi to make good on their unambiguous claims. But both my sister and father (who are lawyers) agree with the ending of the case and say Pepsi should not have been made to give the guy a jet, and since these are two people whom I deeply respect I’m wondering if I’m the one who’s thinking about this in the wrong way or if more people agree with me that it was a classic case of false advertising.","['This is a difficult question to answer.

People who are overweight should be treated with kindness as respect same as anyone else and there’s clear evidence that if people feel worthless, they don’t look after themselves. Shaming fat people doesn’t make them more likely to lose weight. 

That being said, what I’ve seen is body positivity morphing into a belief that there are no health risks associated with severe obesity, or that it’s all about genetics and has nothing to do with lifestyle, poor diet etc.  This is nonsense, the genetic component of obesity is small relative to lifestyle factors and genetic predispositions can be overcome with lifestyle changes. 

The only reason I can see for this is a coping mechanism.  The causes of severe obesity aren’t individual, they’re structural.  American cities are designed for cars so that people don’t walk, the food industry spends billions lobbying politicians to keep shoving sugar down kids throats.  The lack of a real social safety net means people work insane hours for little money and can’t afford healthy food and regular exercise.  They read constant misinformation about fad diets and nonsense medical advice from TikTok “doctors”.   The obesity epidemic is a symptom of a sick society and therefore difficult to fix with a focus on individual actions. 

These problems are so vast and intractable that I think people are just giving up.

127,127,"Firstly, while this sounds quite anti-trans, I for one am not. My political views and a mix of both left and right, so I often find myself arguing with both sides on issues.

Now for the argument. My main thought process is that teens are very emotionally unstable. I recall how I was as a teen, how rebellious, my goth phase, my ska phase, my 'omg I'm popular now' phase, and my depressed phase.

All of that occurred from ages 13 to 18. It was a wild ride.

Given my own personal experience and knowing how my friends were as teens, non of us were mature enough to decide on a permanent life-altering surgery. I know the debate about puberty blockers being reversible, that is only somewhat true. Your body is designed (unless you have very early puberty) to go through puberty at an age range, a range that changes your brain significantly. I don't think we know nearly enough to say puberty blockers are harmless and reversible. There can definitely be the possibility of mental impairments or other issues arising from its usage.

Now that is my main argument.

I know counter points will be:

1. Lots of transgender people knew from a kid and knew for sure this surgery was necessary.
2. Similar to gays, they know their sexuality from a young age and it shouldn't be suppressed

While both of those statements are true, and true for the majority. But in terms of transitioning, there are also many who regret their choice.

**Detransitioned** (persons who seek to reverse a gender transition, often after realizing they actually do identify with their biological sex ) people are getting more and more common and the reasons they give are all similar. They had a turbulent time as a teen with not fitting in, then they found transgender activist content online that spurred them into transitioning.

Many transgender activists think they're doing the right thing by encouraging it. However, what should be done instead is a thorough mental health check, and teens requesting this transition should be made to wait a certain period (either 2-3 years) or till they're 18.

I'm willing to lower my age of deciding this to 16 after puberty is complete. Before puberty, you're too young, too impressionable to decide.

This is also a 2 part argument.

I think we should limit how much we expose kids to transgender ideology before the age of 16. I think it's better to promote body acceptance and talk about the wide differences in gender is ok. Transgender activists often like to paint an overly rosy view on it, saying to impressionable and often lonely teens, that transitioning will change everything. I've personally seen this a lot online. It's almost seen as trendy and teens who want acceptance and belonging could easily fall victim to this and transition unnecessarily.

That is all, I would love to hear arguments against this because I sometimes feel like maybe I'm missing something given how convinced people are about this.

I have mostly changed my view, I am off the opinion now that proper mental health checks are being done.

129,129,"The idea has been thrown around quite a bit lately that if Trump is ever arrested, tried in a court of law, and sentenced to serve time behind bars that there would be a violent backlash in the U.S.--a massive upheaval of the body politic. The claim is that ""The country would not stand for it."" 

I don't believe this is true. It's a canard. It's wishful thinking on Trump's part.

Yes, there would undoubtedly be protests, demonstrations, fire-breathing talking heads, intimidating posts on social media, and maybe even a few isolated outbursts of violence. But these'll all largely fizzle out in short order as Trump fades in America's collective memory. The news cycle would dwell on it for awhile, then look for the next big attention-grabbing event. Not much would change. Life would go on.

The US as a nation seems pretty used to civil unrest and psychopathic bursts of violence by now. If there is an uptick in these phenomena traceable to Trump's arrest, that wouldn't exactly signify anything momentous. If a Trump-sympathetic person goes berserk and hurts people because Trump or his inner circle are apprehended and forced to face consequences, it wouldn't really be all that meaningful, memorable, or original. Of course, it'd be tragic and heartbreaking to see innocent people hurt--but in the long run, any sort of backlash would be relatively minimal, and would be largely forgotten and insignificant in the grand scheme of things. 

A deranged active shooter kills people in a US mall, church, school, or concert? That's basically par for the course in the states, sadly, regardless of the motivation. A mob breaks shop windows downtown, starts fires, and flees from the police? Flip on the news and watch that happen pretty frequently in many major US cities \*right now.\* A pickup truck mows down pedestrians? Again, the nation has become somewhat inured to these sorts of incidents--they aren't exactly the sorts of profound events that would shake the foundations of the republic--even if there would be an above-average smattering of them in the wake of a Trump arrest. (Again, this is not to say that the victims and families caught up in these horrific events wouldn't be forever changed and traumatized--only that from a big picture view, most of the other 330 million Americans would go back to their daily lives.)

Americans shouldn't be scared of riots and organized crime motivated by people who wouldn't be able to fathom that Trump could be held accountable under the law. These are marginalized and fringe actors. The hardcore elements of these factions would eventually be rounded up and imprisoned, too. This is the FBI's bread and butter. They take down crime rings on the regular. Then, all the lukewarm Trump supporters would find another leader to rally behind. They'd hold Trump up as a martyr, yes. But it'd mostly be symbolic. Then they'd move on. Eventually even the references to the perceived injustice of his arrest would fade away. Elements of the GOP would probably breathe a sigh of relief.","[""CMV: We shouldn't rebuild Florida after Hurricane Ian\n\nCMV:\n\nWhile Hurricane Ian is undoubtedly a devastating storm, we should not rebuild Florida after it.

130,130,"Houses in the United States, among other western countries, has increased rapidly, outpacing wage earnings. This has occurred for many reasons.

- Foreign Investors
- Domestic Executive Real Estate Investors
- Supply Chain Issues 
- Labor Shortage Issues
- Low Interest Rates
- Zoning Laws
- High Competition Among the Working Class
- Retail investors looking to rent properties.

The issue has become so concerning because it represents a direct threat to the middle class way of life if most people start being unable to afford homes. Most people perceive this rapid increase as a bubble that will eventually cause prices to crash so they are not worried. I disagree with the conclusions of most people. I think we are witnessing a real time transition in most western countries to a society of highly unequal standards of living.

Canada, Australia, and the UK have had high housing prices for decades at this point, the US is just catching up to other anglophone countries.

As the world becomes more destabilized due to climate change and illiberal regimes asserting their authority, more people are going to want to move to the west or park their money here, further driving up prices.

Banks want to own all the property because it becomes an incredibly stable and lucrative investment and lucrative investment to become the private entity that housing is outsourced to, rather than offer loans. You won’t buy the American dream, you’ll rent it.

Big companies are incentivized to keep property prices high because then it keeps people desperate and willing to work for wages that are low.

There’s only so much land in places like Seattle and Boston so even if we increase density it will still mean homes are expensive because the few that remain in urban areas will be highly desirable and sought out.

Politicians don’t want to solve the issue because they want to keep their investments and portfolios thicc and fat.

Those of us living in the US are not going to ever witness the conditions of the 50s - early 00s ever return because there’s too many forces at work driving it to be the opposite. If society rises up against it it will just destabilize everything as a class power struggle ensues.","['If you are AFK for more than a few minutes, please let an administrator or moderator know so that we can remove you from the team and prevent you from rejoining for a while.

132,132,"To specify, I am not referring to single stall bathrooms, wherein there is a further isolated toilet from the remainder of the bathroom, I am talking specifically about bathrooms in public locations that a realtor would list as a half-bath. I find these most often in older or smaller diner type facilities or gas stations, there is typically a lock on the door, and they are often paired, one for either sex. I think this is a pointless exercise, and can detract from an already messy discussion regarding bathrooms. I am not here to discuss my thoughts on the bathrooms issue as a whole, but only these single-occupant bathrooms.

To start, having 2 single occupant bathrooms as a public facility is already dicey, especially if you have decent foot traffic. However, further restricting access to either bathroom can lead to situations in which one has a line to use, and the other is being unused. Having been in this situation myself, when I suggested we start using the other bathroom to speed things along, I got looked at like I was an alien, and nobody wanted to do it. It was like a stigma built into the social fabric of most people that you shouldn't use the bathroom for the opposite sex under any circumstance. Simply removing the signs would have improved this condition.

Next point, I understand there are sex specific hygiene instruments in some public bathrooms. In the event that those bathrooms become unisex, put them in both, if they need to be there. I find it absolutely insane some men refuse to get hygiene products for their girlfriend/wife, and while I doubt this would eliminate the stigma of being exposed to these products, it could be a change in a positive direction. I don't know, leave that evaluation to the scientists. And if your wife needs tampons, go pick them up.

The final point I can think of is a concern that ""Oh but if the men's line is long, and a woman needs to go, she shouldn't have to wait."" or vice versa. I don't care. First come, first served, same as it is in virtually every other part of the world. The number of problems resolved by switching both bathrooms to unisex outweigh any antiquated sex specific concern, as far as I am concerned.

EDITED TO ADD:
A common talking point I see brought up is in regard to cleanliness. I didn't initially think this would be something I had to address, but I have so many times now I felt it important to add here.

Both sexes have complaints about the other with regard to cleanliness. Both hold valid points, and I don't think one must necessarily outweigh the other. However I don't believe this to be an obstruction to my view because I believe that management should be more responsible and pro-active about cleaning public restrooms. I also think it is much easier for an employee of any sex to go clean the unisex bathroom than it is to make an employee of one sex clean the bathroom of the other sex.

138,138,"There’s three major issues I see in our political system. A) politicians of in any party are allowed decades of ‘service’ and exploit that role to make policy to secure their positions while not doing anything truly beneficial to the people, B) politicians in both parties using decades of political position to very obviously exploit that role for fiscal gain, and C) there’s clear cognitive decline in the older members by form of incoherent babbling during interviews. 

Politicians should have limited power over the people which means they should have a limited time to act in their roles. There’s no benefit to the citizens of this country to have the same do nothing people in office for 20+ years. 

To counter, I propose terms for any office be extended to 5 years for a limit of two terms. If you can’t get anything done in 10 years, you have no business being in that position. 

They should not be able to profit off of policy decisions. The Pelosi family is a prime example, and their massive stock purchases before a policy is made, conveniently making them millions. 

To counter, I propose that A) they should only be able to make the median income of the state they represent coupled with the same benefits that the military receives in terms of a housing allowance based on their districts local rent costs and insurance through Tricare, and B) complete financial transparency as soon as they get on the election path, during their term, and for an additional period of years following them leaving office in order to prevent bribery with criminal charges if discretions are found. 

And take your pick of any politicians, particularly older ones, who sputter complete and utter nonsense. Biden, Trump, or any others. Regardless of your views of either political party, it makes us as a nation look foolish and weak. We need people who are old enough to have the maturity to get the job done but young enough to be mentally fit.

148,148,"All different kinds of people use gyms, right?  There are professional body builders, there are people who genuinely enjoy workouts but aren't there to try to bulk up / slim down, and of course, there are people who really don't want to be there but know that they need to do something to get healthier.  The last group, among whose ranks I used to count myself, are often extremely self conscious about just about every aspect of being there.  Not lifting heavy enough weights.  Not running fast enough on the treadmill.  Not looking as good in my crappy sweatpants and stained baggy t-shirt compared to people wearing over $100 worth of athleticwear.  

And then you have people who think that the gym is their personal fitness TV studio.  If you're a streamer who doesn't care about other people in your shot, then great - now my self-conscious ass is going on the internet for all to see.  If you're a streamer who does care - way too much - about other people being in your shot, then you may end up going off on someone for simply trying to use the gym and getting in your way when all they're doing is trying to access the gym that they paid a membership for.

My view is simple: gyms need to stop allowing this.  Obviously outbursts aren't allowed and actively problematic people will usually be dealt with accordingly, but why even let it get there in the first place?  Why allow recording in a room full of self-conscious, sloppily dressed people?  

And let's look at it from one more angle: what about the women who show up in workout gear that is barely more than a swimsuit, because they know they get really hot during cardio and are just trying to stay cool enough to not completely hate their workout?  Maybe they don't want to be shown like that in the back of some guy's gym videos either and become the target of some creep's online harassment.

149,149,"Ok, so a bit of background.  I'm (47M) an atheist.  Always have been an atheist.  I used to be quite militant and never wanted to engage with religious people, no matter the religion.  I'm from a rural part of the Midwest (quite religious)  and now live in the deep south (quite religious).  In my 30s I began understanding a bit more of what drives some people to attend church and be part of a religion.  Be it about community or upbringing it doesn't matter to me and I have learned to accept their choices without pushing back on the ideology.   Especially since I now know quite a few ""reasonable"" Christians which I would define as those who attend church, believe in Christ,  but also believe that their ideology shouldn't be proselytized to everyone they encounter.  

So when 9/11 happened in NYC, I remember a lot of people (including myself) were adamant that the so-called ""good Muslims"" need to stand up to the ""bad Muslims"" in an effort to prevent the dangerous ideology from spreading.  I still see this as a viable option to limiting the spread of bad ideology.

Even today when I speak with these so-called ""reasonable Christians"" and I say that its Christianity that is leading to America losing the right to free and safe abortions or restricting gay marriage or whatever the flavor of the month is, I'm met with ""Its not all Christians, it is the shitty ones"" or something similar.  

I believe that ""reasonable Christians"" should stand up as a unit (similar to the Evangelicals"") and bear the burden of fighting the foolishness.  Similar to what many Christians asked of ""good Muslims"" after 9/11, I think this should happen in this situation too!  I believe America is on the precipice of a Christian analog to sharia law and it scares the shit out of me.    

To clarify, I'm not saying the ""Reasonable Christians"" should do ALL of the work, I'm just saying their influence could go way farther than secular organizations like The Satanic Temple or such who are working to provide Pro-Choice options.","[""I don't think your siblings feel guilty; they're just proud of you.

This has been obvious for a while. Chanting ""Lock her up"" about Hillary -- basically saying ""Jail our enemies without any indicting charges or trial"" or the multiple hearings over Benghazi despite repeatedly finding no wrong doing, this all showed that the GOP wanted to use the machinery of the law to punish political actors.   


And Trump clearly went out of his way to use the DoJ and other aspects of the justice system to try to punish his enemies, but was stymied for the most part because those in the system, even if otherwise corrupt, refused to subvert the justice system completely. 

Remember, a warrant has to contain: 

a) the substantiated claim of a probable crime has been committed

b) the substantiated claim that evidence of that crime probably exists

c) the substantiated claim that said evidence likely resides in a particular place at a particular time

d) the substantiated claim that there is reason to believe that the evidence can not be retrieved by the government through less aggressive means (such as subpoena)

All of which has to pass the ""sniff"" test of a federal judge. 

This latest outrage shows that a huge number of GOP voters really do think that the rule of law should be abandoned. To be upset about this they have to believe that: 

1) the FBI would submit a request to the DOJ for a search warrant for political payback of some slight

2) A prosecutor would back the FBI and run the warrant up the chain for approval

3) Merrick Garland -- a lifelong republican stalwart servant of the law would subvert the law to the whims of a Democratic president for some personal gain

4) A Federal Judge would sign off on a warrant out of political animus regardless of the legal merit

I get that this is unprecedented in the sense that it has never happened to a former president before. But instead of taking it for what it implies - that Trump was unprecedentedly corrupt, they embrace a further conspiracy theory?!  


The GOP has honestly lost their collective minds. But this demonstrates they are literally unfit to govern anything because to be outraged by this action requires a complete and fundamental disrespect for the rule of law. In order to sustain this believe, they have to believe that literally every branch of the government is corrupt to the point that a president can force federal judges to effectuate extra-judicial searches and seizures upon ex-Presidents.

156,156,"Making this post because I see posts all over social media that are treating Depp's case like it's a slam dunk and that Heard's lawyers are making a mess of their defense, and while I genuinely want that to be true, I think people are caught up in the drama of these two actors and aren't considering what the case is actually about, and I'm pretty sure Depp is going to lose.

Reasons I think this:

1.	Defamation cases are notoriously difficult to win in the United States due to our robust free speech laws. To prove defamation, Depp has to prove both that he was harmed and that Heard's statements about him are untrue. So the onus is on him.
2.	While not exactly the same, Depp has lost a similar case against *The Sun* in the UK, when the paper called him a ""wife beater."" And since US free speech protections are stronger than in the UK, I feel that the same reasoning for that verdict would probably apply here.
3.	This case is not about who was ""worse"" in Depp and Heard's relationship. By all accounts, it sounds like Heard was a manipulative gaslighter who physically abused Depp for years. But this case specifically is about [this op-ed in the Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/ive-seen-how-institutions-protect-men-accused-of-abuse-heres-what-we-can-do/2018/12/18/71fd876a-02ed-11e9-b5df-5d3874f1ac36_story.html). Importantly, Heard never mentions Depp by name, which already makes proving defamation difficult. But since truth is a defense for defamation, if there was ever even *one* instance in which Depp was ever abusive toward Heard, then regardless of how many times Heard was abusive toward Depp, that would be a defense against defamation.

Bottom line is that it seems like a genuinely difficult case to win, and I think people are getting caught up in defending a victim of abuse when they assume Depp is going to win his case.","[""If someone is wearing see-through clothing at the gym, it's best to tell them that it's not appropriate attire and ask them to change.

If you don’t know, the largest bank for tech companies and venture capitalists, Silicon Valley Bank, just went under. Many of these VCs are calling for the government to step up and pay depositors back their money beyond the insured FDIC $250K.

I don’t think taxpayers should be forced to bankroll rich, Silicon Valley executives, most of which are tech bro white men from rich families and networks who could easily make up the funds lost privately.

I’m a founder of a tech startup. I have raised money from investors. I have learned the ins and outs of my industry and have lots of fellow VC-backed founder friends. 

But I don’t think the general taxpayer should be responsible to pay back private deposits that were lost due to the failure of Silicon Valley Bank’s management and the VCs who caused the bank run that led to its demise. If it were me, I’d figure out a way to operate within the insured amount of funds or put my money in various banks for more security. 

The same VC investors who are so gung-ho about capitalism and have no qualms about screwing the poor and middle classes for their own wealth are now expecting the government, and the general population, to bail them out of something they brought upon themselves.

Yes, some of these startups will have to shut down as a result. But being an entrepreneur is about being able to be scrappy, manage resources effectively, and operate in times of uncertainty. Those that fail due to this SVB situation probably were not using the capital efficiently anyway (maybe that private jet and those fancy dinners weren’t the best use of funds, eh?). 

Startups fail all the time because of forces out of their control. This is no different and it shouldn’t be taxpayers’ problem.

CMV!

EDIT: 

1. I’ve gotten a lot of people who assume I don’t know anything about how companies, startups, or VC funding works. I do. I own a tech C-Corp and have a cap table with investors. We run payroll and have multiple business banking and credit accounts. We are early stage and have not raised hundreds of millions of dollars yet, but I understand how it works.

2. I want to clarify that I don’t think these startups should automatically fail. But I think this ‘bailout’ should be dealt with using private funds vs a government purchase or agreement requiring general taxpayers - especially from groups that are consistently and systemically discriminated against by the very investors crying for help right now - to foot the bill for SVB’s collapse.

However, the part of my view that still stands is that US taxpayers should not be responsible for it.

I had this situation I found weird recently where I called myself a retard and people called me out because I shouldnt be using the ""R-word."" I found this extremely weird, even to the point of frustration as it was a big culture shock. My family and friends all revolved around the belief that context matters infinitely more than individual words, so barely any words were off limits.

Anyways, after this incident, I decided to stay up for a few hours to research why ""retard"" was such a taboo word. After reviewing a bunch of articles and videos, the consensus seems to be - ""The word retard has been used to harm/put down people and therefore should not be used."" 

But to me, that makes no sense at all. If I used the word Fat as an example, I could call myself fat and no one would bat an eye, but if I call someone fat with the intent of harm - then fat fits in to the same criteria as retard.

I could also give an example of being rude or harmful without even using words. If I go up to someone with a serious mental disorder and say aggresively, ""The fuck is wrong with you?"" Im fairly sure that could be taken at a serious level of harm as just saying retard.

But all of these examples dont address the point of context - Any and every word can be used to induce harm, so why do we categorize specific words as off limits?

163,163,"From my perspective, drowning deaths are some of the most preventable deaths out there. My overall view is that swimming should be taught in elementary school as part of the curriculum either in the school itself or at a local swim school for the majority of children.

Let's look at the stats first. According to the CDC drowning is the second leading cause of death in kids aged 1-4 after birth defects and also the second leading cause of death in kids 1-14 after car accidents.\^1 Further, the Red Cross reports that 54% of Americans either can't swim or don't have all the basic swimming skills.\^2 Further, there are an average of 3,960 fatal drownings a year and 8,080 nonfatal drownings a year.\^1 Further, the data shows that swimming lessons decreases children ages 1-4's risk of drowning by 88%.\^3 We also know that white people are more likely to be able to swim than black or indigenous Americans, which is likely due, in part, to socioeconomic factors. 

Now onto the argument. Knowing how to swim is, in my opinion, one of the best skills to learn in order to decrease your chances of preventable death. I don't think its unreasonable to claim that most people will find themselves in or near a body of water at some point in their lives. Outside of infants who have a swimming diving reflex, swimming is not an innate ability in humans and must be learned. My argument is that we should incorporate swimming lessons into elementary school (or higher levels, although I think earlier is better) curriculums across the country. 

I think the benefits of something like this are rather obvious, a huge proportion of the US population is unable to swim proficiently and implementing this as a part of school curriculums would help to eliminate many barriers that currently exist for parents. Most prominently, it would eliminate financial barriers and wouldn't need parents to take time out of their days to take their children to swim lessons. While obviously the most benefit is gained from teaching kids as young as possible, most children don't start public school until age 5 or 6 so its the best we can do. 

Now I know there are a number of reasons why this is difficult, the main difficulty is access to pools. Now I've been unable to locate any statistics on what percentage of US school districts either have a pool in a school building or have access to a community pool (and if someone does have this data it would be useful, one thought I had is this may potentially be related to the percentage of school districts with water polo teams). I say school districts here because for this to work, you wouldn't need a pool in each elementary school, rather you just need your school district to have access to a pool. Obviously pools owned by school districts are more likely in wealthier and more populous areas so my alternative here would be for schools to have some partnership program with local swim centers. I don't think the actual curriculum element would be that difficult to implement, elementary students have buses and go on field trips so there could simply be one week in which instead of going to PE the students would go to a swim class. I know another issue here may be funding related, I am, admittedly, unsure of how much something like this would cost school districts to implement in general but I'm also of the mindset that we need to increase school funding in general anyways. For the purposes of this CMV Im arguing more for a general push to get these kinds of programs implemented in schools and not so much ""these need to be the top priority immediately"". 

There are also some concerns I can see brought up with the data here. First is that one of the studies I linked below (link 3 or 4 for a condensed version) did an analysis on kids aged 5-19 and found no statistically significant link between informal instruction and drowning risk. I do have a problem with this study though as they have an n value of 27 which, to me at least, seems quite low for their purposes. Further, I was unable to find data on drowning rates in adults correlated with swimming competency. 

There may be things I've missed here or not explained well enough but I'd love to have my view challenged or changed or for people to present other ideas on ways to implement these kinds of programs or simply alternative methods.

164,164,"I know this is a confusing topic because we have a special connotation for people who have biological children. They're *their* children. But I think the logical inconsistency here is too glaring to ignore: we require people be above the poverty line in order to adopt children...

>According to the USCIS, **adoptive parents must have a household income equal to or higher than 125% of the US poverty level** for your household size. Your household size includes you, your dependents, any relatives living with you, and the child you wish to adopt.

No such requirement exists for biological parents. But we have this requirement for adoptive parents. Is it because we acknowledge that if you can't take care of yourself and can't earn an income, you shouldn't be raising kids? Yes, right? So to me it's very strange that nobody bats an eye when this is the case with people who have biological children.

I understand that the alternative is draconian and troubling to think about - but we have CPS for a reason, right? If a child is in an unsafe environment and situation, CPS will take them away. But for adults who have their own biological children despite having no income and no prospect of having an income, they're just given money by the government through welfare/WIC/SNAP/etc. So this creates a perverse incentive for otherwise non-productive members of society to have children in order to live a viable life.

So what's to be done about this? I don't know, but at least in sort of philosophical terms, you should acknowledge the stark cognitive dissonance between believing that penniless people should be allowed to have biological children while also agreeing that adoptive parents should have a minimum income.

For at least some of the people who are only able to care for their children thanks to social programs, if not for these welfare-based income streams, wouldn't their child be in an unsafe situation and therefore be taken away by CPS?

I don't know, I feel conflicted about this topic. On the one hand, I guess if you're an adequate parent even if you're reliant on unearned income, having kids is...*okay?* But on the other hand, if this system fell apart or was otherwise discontinued, many of these kids would be taken away by CPS which would then burden the system even more. If for some reason this massive social support system for penniless parents vanished, it's likely that the government wouldn't have the funds to support these kids through other means. That would result in widespread death and suffering of these kids, or if not, it would come at the expense of some other group who would then experience suffering and death.

It's a house of cards system which is reliant on taxes from the very wealthy ([the top 20% are responsible for 80% of income tax revenue](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/08/18/61percent-of-americans-paid-no-federal-income-taxes-in-2020-tax-policy-center-says.html)) in order to support parents who would otherwise be deemed unfit. It's just a very strange system and I don't think it's sustainable or organic in any way.

And not to mention the fact that for these parents who are reliant on welfare to raise their children, these children are still in environments of poverty, which is well-documented to have adverse effects on children who grow up and live in those environments - these children will often grow up and be non-contributing members of society or even actively hurt society. One might even argue that this welfare system of enabling otherwise unfit parents is a big reason why we have so much crime/violence/drug addiction in many parts of the country.

There is biological sex --> Which led to different social roles, and then socialized gender.

In the modern day with modern technology. You can live life how you generally please. Women don't need to be child bearers. And men don't need to be out risking their lives killing things.

To me this means, that the traditional gender roles don't matter. You can be a male and wear makeup, high heels and a dress. Who cares?

Likewise if you're a biological female, you can do things that used to be considered masculine. It's a free country.You can also fit squarely into those old gender roles if you so choose.

168,168,"It seems to be a widely shared belief that civilians armed with the kind of weapons - pistols, shotguns, semi-automatic rifles - permitted under the 2nd amendment could successfully overthrow the US government (and that this is a good thing because it keeps the US government from becoming a tyranny). I don't find this credible since the US military is so large, well-equipped, and trained that it seems obviously capable of defeating a bunch of civilians.

The main counter-argument I have come across is ""Look at Vietnam, Afghanistan, Iraq, etc. Clearly the US can be defeated by lightly armed but highly motivated rebels""

But I don't think these examples demonstrate that.

1. In all those cases, the rebels were supported by hostile neighbouring countries (N. Vietnam even got MiG fighter jets), so it wasn't true that the US was fighting the rebels alone. This would not be the case for a US rebellion. (In addition, such external support and safety allows insurgents to organise themselves and thereby become far more effective than a bunch of similarly motivated fighters would be.)
2. In all those cases, the US government was defending non-vital interests, and withdrew when it was clear that the cost of defending those interests was greater than giving them up. In contrast, a domestic revolution threatens the very existence of the US government so it would not have the option to walk away. (Compare with the US civil war, in which the US government was prepared to pay, as a proportionate of the then population, more lives than all America's other wars put together. Also contrast with the success of the US war of independence - Britain walked away from a war of choice when it got too expensive.)
3. (I put this last point in parentheses because it relates more to the claim that the second amendment protects against tyranny. The central strategy of all those rebel groups was terrorism against other civilians. They challenged the ability of the local government to protect civilian populations - especially outside cities - from political violence, and thereby undermined the legitimacy of the official government. Essentially this is a strategy of mafia-like extortion rather than liberation.)

Have I missed something?

*Note: I am focused here on disproving the specific claim that civilians with small-arms could overthrow the US government. I won't engage with commenters regarding the wider issue of gun control unless it is relevant to that.*

&#x200B;

EDIT: A lot of people are referencing the Jan 6 insurrection as an example of an almost successful armed civilian overthrow of the government. But this did not come close to overthrowing the US government (or rather, overturning the will of the democratic majority to end the Trump government). Furthermore, it would have been even less successful if it had succeeded further in either its more violent aspirations (by hanging Mike Pence, Nancy Pelosi, etc in the Senate chamber) or its more pseudo-law aspirations (make Pence sign something that declares Trump the winner). This is because none of those 'successes' would have weakened the power/authority of the US government one jot, but they would have provoked a far more unified and severe response.

Edit 2: I am finding a lot of wishful thinking in the arguments being brought here. In particular, many arguments seem to depend on the US government occupying an improbable sweet spot where it is sufficiently tyrannical to inspire very large numbers of civilians to risk their lives to overthrow it, while also not being so tyrannical that it would use its resources as ruthlessly as [real tyrannical regimes do](https://mwi.usma.edu/dont-underestimate-the-bear-russia-is-one-of-the-worlds-most-effective-modern-counterinsurgents/) when suppressing uprisings. For example, people keep repeating the claim that US soldiers would refuse orders to shoot at US civilians because they swore an oath to  justice or something. Or that the US government would find it politically embarrassing to kill large numbers of rebel civilians. I call this wishful thinking or fantasy because it offers a defense of the effectiveness of 2nd amendment remedies based on assuming very specific and convenient conditions (often apparently only to be found in the case of America).

So basically, in the US insurance companies can pretty much arbitrarily decide which medications and treatments are or are not covered in your healthcare plan, regardless of whether or not they are deemed necessary by a medical professional.

It is my view that if a doctor deems a treatment or medication necessary for a patient, an insurance company should be legally obligated to cover it as if it was covered in the first place.

I believe that an insurance company does not have the insight, expertise or authority to overrule a doctor on whether or not a medication is necessary. Keep in mind that with how much medication and treatments cost, denying coverage essentially restricts access to those for many people, and places undue financial burden on others.

Teachers and tutors are a pivotal part of this process. These bottleneck innovations take our entire concept of civilization forward. There is no way to account for this cost, there is no price tag that is too high. We cannot afford to waste any talent because they were not sufficiently taught in their development.

Finally, there is a teacher shortage both in quantity and quality because teachers are not respected as a profession, and because they are not compensated, which, is probably because they are not respected enough.

181,181,"Think of all the things we don’t let 18 year olds do—they can’t drink or smoke. They are barely able to vote and don’t gain too many legal privileges until they are actually 21 years old. We say that this is because their decision making faculties are not yet fully developed so they need to wait. 

So where is this logic when it applies to college?? We actively encourage kids to place themselves into binding contracts where they may have to spend a decent chunk (or the rest) of their lives paying back up to 300k in student loans. How is an 18 year old, who is legally barely capable of anything, understand the true implications of such a decision? They wouldn’t be able to grasp how much money that is, and fewer are even sure of what they truly want to do for the rest of their lives (which generally extends college, making it more expensive). 

I think this is predatory and really, really fucking stupid.







Okay, I tried to write a comment to expand on my argument but it removed it so I'll add it to my original post. 


Okay, first off hi everyone! 


I’m sorry, I wrote this in the morning in a bad mood and was honestly not expecting to receive this many responses. I didn’t really elaborate on what I meant and kinda just wrote something with a dramatic title. I do think that people should seek higher education if they can, but I think it is becoming a less sound decision in the US when so many people lack guidance in the college process and the general public sentiment is to “go to college for a good job”. This is absolutely a systemic issue but regardless of whose fault it is, I do believe it is unreasonable that teens these days are being encouraged to take on this kind of debt. 



Some background on me (which isn’t really interesting but gives more context) is that I was funneled into going to a four year university with no knowledge of any alternative options. 

I have the privilege of my tuition fees being covered by my parents, but the primary earner in my family has faced the unexpected loss of his job and will likely not find another job in his career. This means I might have to take out loans and I am not sure if this is worth it considering I:

a) have career interests outside of university prospects (not requiring a degree)

and 

b) was a very stupid 18 year old lacking goals and I now am only semi-sure of what I am doing at school. 


I know these are a specific set of circumstances most of you are not experiencing, but it prompted me to post this take. 

I am certainly off-base in who I am blaming (I am not even certain on whom), but I do really view student loans as something that can be incredibly damaging. I find this problematic when I believe the young students taking them out aren’t fully aware of the implications of these loans. I probably could have titled this post more accurately, maybe something along the lines of “we need to stop stigmatizing teens for not going to college” or “we don’t talk about how going to college can easily become a huge mistake”. 

Many teens go to college because they think they “should”, and this is truly what I believe is wrong when a lot of undergraduates find themselves in college with no plan besides having gone there. I think this generally ends up wasting money and leading to an inefficient college experience where students do not make the most of their time or their college resources. This is especially unfortunate when graduates can spend a lifetime paying back their student loans. This crisis can be averted by preparing teens better for university (by informing them of what they’re getting into!!) and additionally providing them with options other than four year colleges or universities. IMO, college is now becoming something most people cannot afford to just do for the experience. 



Anyways, here are some responses I have to some comments I’ve seen a lot of. 


1: college students fresh out of high school are more likely to continue to grind, therefore making completing a degree easier for them than it would be for an older adult with other responsibilities outside of school. 


I completely agree with this point! It is definitely easier to complete school right from high school because it is what is familiar to them. 


I think the problem is that a lot of individuals are “grinding” without an overarching goal, which oftentimes leads to some sort of existential crisis and burnout. “Sophomore blues” don’t exist without a reason. I think it is easier for people to do what they must when they have clear goals in mind. It is already starting to take the average undergrad 5 years to complete a degree due to changing majors and academic leave. People who know what they’re there to do usually make more use out of their experience and have more discipline. But yes, it can definitely be harder to keep up with the pace while juggling more responsibilities.



2: this is an American problem. 


True, and we envy you! It is definitely wise for US citizens looking to go to college to look into doing their schooling abroad these days (even though I understand you might not want us lol). 



3: 300k is inaccurate


Yeah, my bad. I’m definitely in the wrong there. 


Something I will throw in there, though, is that many college graduates are starting to go to graduate school with the belief that it will bring them financial stability, which oftentimes easily pushes tuition fees past the 100k mark. 




4: the return is better with a college degree


Yes, many studies point to this. However, depending on your career choice, getting started as young as possible may serve you better for future returns. 


Someone wrote something about how people aren’t going to college to do their “influencing” careers (or something with crypto). This is not what I mean by a career—I am talking about a career path with steady income and employment that is not based on some component of luck in order to make it big. 

When it comes to four year colleges, I am also talking about how we don’t inform teens on precautionary measures they can take to reduce their debt—I don’t mean that teens should completely avoid college. Students can take prerequisite courses at community colleges in order to avoid taking these same classes at a higher cost at a college or university. We don’t really help teens find ways they can lessen the blow of loans, and yeah, I do find that kind of cruel. 





5: I think it’s unjust that 18 year olds can go to college but can’t smoke. 


No, I just find it interesting that we think 18 year olds aren’t responsible enough to make many decisions (those were examples, maybe bad ones) yet it is completely normalized for 18 year olds to take on significant amounts of debt for schooling. When it comes to many other matters, the consensus is that 18 year olds are too naïve or unaware of what they are doing to the point of which we actually bar them from taking various actions to protect them. We tend to think 18 year olds have a very poor gauge of money and its value. 


Someone wrote a good point that 18 year olds are able to make other financial decisions such as taking out loans on cars, marriage, and applying for credit. My response is that these decisions are, for the most part, actually highly discouraged for 18 year olds to make. People generally think that 18 year olds should avoid taking out loans on things they can’t afford/repay and most 18 year olds who buy cars only buy them outright. I don’t know a single person who thinks getting married before 25 is acceptable, and credit limits are incredibly low for 18 year olds because most of them make little to no income. Therefore, I find it odd that society encourages teens to take on student debt (a loan that, for the most part, the repayment of is uncertain) and view those who do otherwise as “not caring” for their future. Kids in college who are paying money and don’t care about their future are making a far worse choice. 



6: going to college puts you around good influences and gives you plenty of networking opportunities. 


I mean, sure I guess? You can find bad people anywhere, and I wouldn’t call the binge drinking or hazing cultures that take place at colleges influential. In fact, at many of these wealthy institutions kids do a lot more drugs than most people outside of college who can’t afford boatloads of coke. 


Also, this idea that the “good people are in college” comes from the same sentiment that stigmatizes teens who do not attend college. Also, I think it’s pretty weird that people seem to think that successful networking is only done in college. You can form connections to anyone anywhere, really (also, as someone who is around a lot of people who call making friends “networking”, it seems pretty superficial). 



7: people figure themselves out in college. 


This is subjective, and there are many less expensive (maybe even free!) ways to develop your sense of identity and goals in life. Speaking for myself, I figured out my direction in life entirely outside of university and college feels like a fever dream. I can’t give an objective response to this point but I don’t agree that adolescents can only “find themselves” in this bubble that is quite detached from real life. 


Overall, what I’m saying is that college is becoming less and less the “right choice” for a lot of people: the degree market is oversaturated, the undergraduate unemployment rate is growing, and job security is rapidly on the decline. I think these reasons make a good case for teens to explore alternative options such as trade schools (job growth out of trade schools are growing rapidly) and rethink whether college is pivotal or not to their personal and financial success. Yeah, I do find it pretty cruel that we throw kids into making these decisions when they are, for the most part, ill-informed. It’s especially messed up when we all kind of know that college tuition in the US is fucking ridiculous and a bachelor’s degree doesn’t hold the same value it used to.

183,183,"Trauma researcher John Briere (a professor of psychiatry and psychology at USC) once said:

>If we could somehow end child abuse and neglect, the eight hundred pages of DSM \[the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders\] would be shrunk to a pamphlet in two generations.

I agree with this basic contention. In my experience, most of what people experience as mental illness is a result of something that has happened to them in the past (traumatic events like physical or emotional abuse, natural disaster, or other highly stressful situations), or something that hasn't happened to them that they needed to be physically and mentally healthy (emotional or physical neglect, which can also be considered a form of trauma).

In other words, ""mental illness"" is mostly a manifestation of a person's adaptations to trauma. Due to stressful and difficult situations of abuse or neglect, the brain naturally develops adaptations to help that person cope with the difficult situation that is (or seems to be) beyond their control. Even if they are removed from the traumatic situation later, these learned adaptations, these patterns of thinking and behavior, persist. Hyper-vigilance. Anxiety. Lethargy and depression. Hyperactivity. Dissociation/""zoning out"". And so on.

Many of these cognitive patterns and behaviors that were originally learned for a ""good"" reason (to help that person mentally protect themselves from the trauma they experienced) can later get in the way of that person living a happy and fulfilling life. We then call those mal-adaptations ""mental illness"".

I take issue with this because thinking of these adaptations (that once were good but now are counter-productive) as an ""illness"" encourages us to treat them the same way we treat physical illnesses. We look for physical/chemical explanations of the problem (imbalance of serotonin / norepinephrine / dopamine, for example) and physical/chemical solutions to the problem (psychiatric medication).

I don't deny that chemical medications can be helpful in many cases, but the core of this argument is that chemical medications are treating the symptoms, rather than the root cause, of mental illness. For a person to truly heal, addressing the root cause is necessary. In most people, this requires restoring the inner sense of safety that they were deprived of in some way through their traumatic experiences. Allowing them to safely re-process their traumatic memories and recontextualize them in the present, and understand on a deep emotional and psychological level that they are safe now, is the best way to help them heal.

I also recognize that there are some conditions labeled as mental disorders that do provably result from congenital neurological abnormalities or physical injury to the brain, but as I see it these are a small minority of all ""mental health"" cases. Most mental illnesses, in my view, fall under the broad category of ""induced maladaptations"", with their primary causes being experiential in nature (trauma) rather than chemical.

I am curious to hear other perspectives or evidence suggesting that the chemical imbalance theory of mental illness is more appropriate - either that it enhances our understanding of mental disorders and how to treat them effectively more than I am giving it credit for, or that it is otherwise more correct than the trauma-focused approach in some other aspects.

I've become a bit overwhelmed by all the replies and response to this post.

184,184,"For context, I am a black male who works in tech. 

In recent years, there has been a movement to purge the words 'master' and 'slave' from the tech industry. I understand why it seems like a good idea. The purge is meant to create a more welcoming atmosphere for people of color to work in. However, I don't think the removal of the words empowers POC tech workers but achieves the opposite. 

'Master' and 'slave' are not the 'N' word in the sense that they do not exist to solely denigrate a population. Nor are they the 'F' word, which had a different historical meaning but is now used as a slur to attack members of the LGBT community. 

The term in and of itself is agnostic. It does not inherently refer to people or a group of people, but the relationship between two nouns (I believe historically it was used to describe the relationship between hard drives in an array). 

By removing these words from the field, we are affirming the idea that the words refer to individuals. This correlation does not serve to empower but instead creates false correlation where the words are now as abhorrent as the 'N' and 'F' words. That they referred to a group of people all along. 

Removing the words also removes the dialogue. It side-steps the actual, societal issue - that we, as people of color, still identify with these terms. Still think of ourselves in these terms.

I don't want to disparage advocates of this movement by calling it 'virtual signaling'. I truly appreciate the efforts to make the workplace more inclusive. It means people are thinking about ways to support their colleagues, however small.

But in reality, people don't care about equality in ALL careers, just ones that look cool on paper and will make a lot of money.  And that really isn't good either.

Now of course, I'm not saying there is no push for these things, but it isn't nearly as widespread.  Talk to any girl/young woman who has been in middle or high school for the last 20 years, and I can almost guarantee that at some point, they were pushed to go into a STEM field.

Why don't we see a big push for more women in trades, which is also well paying and dominated by men?  What about working on oil rigs?  Its dangerous, but pays well.  Its because those jobs aren't ""sexy"" or flashy.  They are hard work that people are fine leaving to me.  Or why don't we see a big push for men in education?  As a former teacher, god knows that in the US we could use more balance in who is literally teaching our youth.

I fully believe we should be making sure students know all of the options that are out there, but not pushing them in a specific way for optics sake.

That said, I feel like some of the points pro lifers make are either ignored or tangentially addressed by pro choicers so I wanted to know what you guys think. 

Pro lifers love to call abortions “baby killing.” I don’t agree, but I honestly think people who call fetuses “clumps of cells” are missing the point. 

What the fetus is missing out on is their future life and personhood. I don’t think most prolifers consider a fetus nearly as developed as a born baby, rather they place the emphasis on the chance at life the fetus was robbed of. 

For example if a baby dies in a car crash, people say things like “they had very loving parents and a bright future ahead of them.” Why doesn’t that apply to fetuses? Just because they’re temporarily biologically dependant on their mother? 

I don’t think it’s fair to call them clumps of flesh or even compare them to tumours(a common argument I see all over Reddit). I mean, a tumour isn’t going to grow into a fucking person with emotions and self awareness. Yet redditors will go ballistic when humans are compared to objects in those dumb boomer memes. (To be fair they are dumb) 

Second point I feel isn’t really addressed is the “abortion is mostly used as birth control” argument. Rape victims definitely deserve the right to abortions if they want one, but I haven’t really seen pro choicers address the fact that MOST people use abortions as a form of birth control. If it’s used as birth control and if you consider a fetus a person, I feel the morality of aborting normal, non rape babies becomes mildly questionable. If you consider a fetus enough of a human being due to religion or whatever reason, you would essentially be weighing the importance of a life against a costly mistake. 

Third point is the “men have no say in women’s bodies” point. That makes sense if you consider a fetus a part of their mother’s body, but not if you consider a fetus a human. If you consider a fetus a human, the debate is no longer about women’s bodies, it’s human lives, and that concerns the entire human race. 

I feel like most pro choice arguments are only completely sound if you consider a fetus a 100% non living thing with 0 rights or desire to live. I haven't figured out how much of a person I consider fetuses yet, so I can't say much about that.

192,192,"This view seems like common sense to me - but at least once a day I see someone fail to use a turn signal so obviously the opposing view is quite common. 

I drive mainly in a large city in California - but I've driven in 49 states, 6 Canadian provinces, as well as in Japan for several years. Everything I say will be from the left hand drive (American) perspective. 

Some appropriate times to use a turn signal: turning left or right, changing lanes or merging, going in or out of a parking lot/driveway, navigating inside a parking lot, etc. 

Why is it important to use every time?

1) Safety of bicycles/pedestrians - I commute by bicycle and being able to anticipate automobile movement is essential to my safety. A driver doing something unpredictable threatens my life. If a driver doesn't signal when turning right and I pass them on the right side - if they start turning instead of proceeding straight then can kill me. Yesterday I was walking with my baby in a stroller and a guy didn't signal and almost hit my baby. What was he thinking?

2) Safety of other drivers - Anticipating what other drivers are going to do is essential to safe defensive driving. The especially occurs when people change lanes without signaling. Why would you do that?

3) It doesn't cost you anything and literally means lifting your finger. - There is an expression ""too lazy to lift a finger"" This literally describes these people. This is why I call them selfish jerks, they are just thinking of themselves and not their impact on others. 

4) You don't always know that ""no one else is around"" I imagine some people will say ""if no one else is around who cares"" Well you don't know that. Often when I bicycle it's possible I'm in a car's blind spot and people who are used to driving in rural/suburban areas aren't used to looking for bikers anyway when they come to the city.  Or when I walk at night with dark clothes. How do you know that know one is there for sure? It doesn't cost you anything to signal so just do it.

193,193,"This is something I seem to struggle with when these types of discussions come up with family, friends, or whomever.

I'm 37m, married, no kids yet.  At no point in my life, if I ever got anyone pregnant, did I support the idea of getting an abortion (other than cases of death to mom).  Meaning if I accidentally got someone pregnant at 17, I'd be upset but I personally wouldn't consider abortion an option.  I would have changed whatever I had to change to care for a child.

Because of this many who have asked me a question that brings up that scenario it's equated to “I'm anti abortion""

The way I've chosen to live my life is....  If it's not negatively affecting me or someone I can help... Then why stop it from happening?  If someone wants to paint their house pink why would I have the authority to stop them?  If it doesn't concern me in anyway then why stop someone else from doing something.  This is how I view most situations.   This doesn't mean I don't have opinions one way or another about something someone is doing.... But if it's none of my business, then it's none of my business.

  As it pertains to abortion, Just because I felt I could figure out my situation to care for a child at that age doesn't mean others can.  So I'm all for that as an option for others, it was just not a decision I would have supported if I were in that situation. A Safe abortion as an alternative to potentially millions of unwanted non or under parented kids growing up and....well.... Possibly being dick head, should (continue to) be a thing.

I've been accused of ""riding the fence"".  I've been accused of not supporting women's rights, I've been accused of being a baby murderer.  I've been told by many that I need to ""pick a side"".  And stop being wishy washy.   

I'm pretty firm in my beliefs.  Am I wrong about feeling like the best is staying out of making decisions for other people?

Edit: haven't gotten through all the replies. My wife and I are on vacation and walking around the city we are in.  I'll get to the rest. Keep them coming.

So far for those that have said...  Yes I support the idea of pro choice for all.  But the point I'm making is, the conversations I have I'm constantly told ""what I am"" and ""why I should be"" etc etc.

Edit 2: so many good responses. Thank you everyone for the discourse.

I wanted to clear up a few things and post things I keep having to repeat.

First off, no one has changed my view but a few people have pointed out that it's very easy for me to say what I would do in a situation that I've not actually been in.  I fully agree with that. Being faced with an actual decision is different than hypothetically considering it.

Second, the scenario about my wife has come up.  My wife and I are just starting to try to have a child.  So other than the case of medical danger to her or the child, this isn't something we have to consider right now.

I believe my wife doesn't need my consent for anything, just like I don't need hers.  Obviously if one of us wants to do something major then we consult the other. Not because we have to, but because we believe we have a healthy marriage and are super happy being with each other...and we want that to continue.

So yes, for those that have commented about it. I support my wife in getting in abortion without consulting with me because she doesn't need to...... But then I wouldn't consider our marriage very healthy.... So it would probably be over or close to it.

But most are missing the larger point here.  My point is.... Why is it any of my business if any of you fine people want an abortion? For whatever the reason.  Because you aren't ready, you can't afford it, you hate that baby shark song... Whatever.  I don't ever want to get one.  But that doesn't mean I should have to know if anyone else does, nevermind have a say in it. It's none of my business.  

Speaking of my wife we are currently in Europe and on vacation so I'm sorry I only got to a fraction of your comments.  But German beers await me!

Final edit: ok time for me to call it quits.  No one changed my view but I think some good points were made.  And some people accused me of the things they always do.  Here are the highlights:

Because of my opinion I'm:
A copout, 
Afraid to be pro choice, 
A leftist, 
A libertarian, 
Pro rape, 
Pro murder,

199,199,"There's a lot of uproar right now about making Ariel black in the little mermaid. Because of the backlash, which I believe to be largely racist opposition to having black characters in media, many people in response have rallied to defend the movie. However I think we are forgetting just how problematic this movie's plot is.

&#x200B;

Let's recall: the movie is about a *16 year old girl*, who sees a man without speaking a word to him, decides she is in love with him, gives up her entire life and *gives up her voice* and has to make him fall in love with her *without even speaking to him*. 

&#x200B;

At one point Ursula says, ""The men up there don't like a lot of blabber... They dote and swoon and fawn on a lady who’s withdrawn. It's she who holds her tongue who gets her man.” Which would be a fine thing for the villain to say, if she was proven wrong in the end. But she isn't! Ariel gets the guy by being silent and not saying a single word. Prince Eric's love for her is essentially, based entirely on lust. It basically tells little girls that their only value is what they look like.

&#x200B;

In the movie, giving up your ability to speak so a man you don't know anything about will find you attractive turns out to be a good decision for the main character. This seems to be a hopelessly misogynistic message. So while I support increased representation in media, the Little Mermaid is a poor vessel for doing so because its message is so problematic. 

&#x200B;

Of course, it is possible that they will change the plot of the movie, but they would essentially have to change the entire conflict of the central plot (Ariel's inability to speak) to make it work. Given how engrained the misogyny is to the plot itself, it seems extremely difficult to do so.","[""We understand that bras can be pretty uncomfortable and we want to help you find a solution.

okay so i’ve (23f) recently just got out of a relationship and wasn’t in the correct head space to date or even causally see men, but one of my friends introduced me to her friend (27m) and we immediately clicked. we met once with her and then two times on our own. 
it was going really well and he made me feel very comfortable and never made any unnecessary sexual advances, he was being sweet and considerate and is very good looking too so i was started to get attracted to him. anyway, we met for dinner and drinks and it was going super well, he was ticking all the boxes and he even got me flowers! one thing led to another and we ended up at his place. i wasn’t drunk, i was one level more than tipsy and he seemed fairly sober. 

we started making out and that was the first time i’d gotten so close to him physically and i noticed a funky smell. i couldn’t quite put my finger on it and i thought it was outside smell (whatever that is lol) but as i unzipped his pants it hit me and i gagged completely because of reflexes and then looked down and it was bright red and with what looked like patches of dry skin on it. i excused myself to go to the bathroom and tried to stall so i could think of what to do. after 5-6 minutes i came out and said “did you want to go as well?” in an attempt to make him check himself out, but he said no and pushed my head down towards his penis and i almost gagged again because the smell was so strong and it looked so .. off . like swollen and sore, but i didn’t want to be rude so i said i feel sick and wanted to leave and he immediately got defensive and said you can’t just give me blue balls and leave you have to finish what you started. so i left. 

the next day he had texted to ask if i’d want to come over again and i haven’t replied.

update : i told him he might have a yeast infection and it’s always good to get it checked out and he said this happens often, so i asked why he doesn’t do anything about it and he said he’s never really had an issue with it and neither have the girls he’s been with. ??? what? that HAS to be a lie. so either he’s never really been with women before or the women he’s seeing are blind and don’t have the sense of smell. can’t be anything else. dodged a bullet with this one damn",False

I just can't wrap my head around it and I don't have anyone else to talk to. Been with my wife for quite a while. Sex has always been a point of contention (classic high libido husband/low libido wife situation, wife has some mental health issues that affect her deeply sometimes, birth control, etc). We've been to couple's counselling, as well as my own individual therapy. I've put in the work, suffice to say.

I never pestered her (asked maybe once a week).  I take care of her, make all the dinners, I'm the only one working full time, helped her get into intensive therapy, we go on dates, etc. I'm not trying to frame this as ""I've done all this so I should get sex"", but I've seen other threads where men have asked for advice and the immediate responses are ""you don't do enough"". Frankly, I really can't do anything more. 

After years and years of really trying, and being the only one to initiate, or the only one to show any genuine desire, I essentially gave up. It became clear that our sex life wasn't going to be what I wanted, and I got fed up of being the only one not only to initiate sex, but initiate conversations surrounding sex. I'm happy with other aspects of our relationship, so while I'm not exactly thrilled to be wholly unfuckable at the ripe age of 33, I don't see much sense in dwelling on it.

Recently though, I think my wife took notice of my lack of initiating and asked what was up. I didn't lie, and told her it didn't seem worth pursuing anymore. I reminded her that in the last six months, she accepted sex all of three times. I said it's clear she has other priorities in life and our relationship, and that it wasn't really healthy for me to try getting blood from a stone. 

She started sulking and complained about how that wasn't fair of me, how she has this and that problem, how she's working on this and that. I acknowledged all that, but I said ultimately, it leaves me in a constant state of rejection, and I'd rather go through life knowing I'm not going to have sex anymore than take the constant emotional damage that comes with her physically reeling away when I touch her. 

She immediately said I was being unfair, and started bringing up things we've hashed out in therapy. We got into a bit of an argument, and I asked her to name the last time she approached me for sex, which I reminded her was only because she was off her birth control due to supply issues (which is...an entirely separate issue. I've offered numerous times to get a vasectomy or to help her change to and pay for a non-hormonal birth control but she takes it to stop her period and help her skin, 'not for sex' as she put it, so it's 'not worth changing or stopping'). 

I ended up walking away from the conversation, but I can't make sense of it. Why would my wife - who shows no sexual interest unless off her birth control, barely engages in physical intimacy without pulling away, and declines every sexual advance I make - find it ""unfair"" that I've more or less stopped bothering? Wouldn't this be exactly what she wanted?

Just thought it would be nice to share, for girls in a similar boat as me. Also, TMI and long post warning lol. 

So to preface, I’d like to say: I’m a clit girl through and through, and I’ve honestly never felt like I was missing out on much, because give me 30 seconds, my right hand and i could basically finish multiple times back to back with no problem. 

Of course, like other women I’m sure I googled “how to find gspot” “can’t gspot orgasm” many a times, with no real revelation or success. 

I think my biggest problem was I was going about it too clinically. I would set up an evening, a mirror (not how i usually masturbate alone at all) and basically experiment and try to figure out wtf the gspot is- and I would always come out slightly disappointed but also affirmed that I can only orgasm via external clit stimulation. 

That, and also I’ve masturbated the same exact way and technique basically since I was a kid, so I felt like my body was too conditioned to orgasm one way to “switch it up”. 

Well, recently I’ve decided to do a Google search again and read the “gspot” is basically the extension of the clit, and even though I KNEW this anatomically, I just thought mine wasn’t prominent (?) or my body just wasn’t build for penetrative orgasms. 

Anyway, I went about my day not thinking about it much, and then last night before bed I decided to masturbate (my usual routine). 
Now, because I can finish myself so fast, It’s not unusual for me to edge myself a few times before I finish and go to sleep lol. Last night I ended up edging myself probably 5-6 times, and you know when ur rly horny/rly close to finishing ur clit gets erect? Well I was like, it’s pretty swollen at this stage, I wonder if that means I can find my gspot, since it’s technically part of the clit. 

I decided to feel the inside, expecting what I usually felt- a very mild, pleasant feeling. And to my surprise I felt the fated “spongey” g-spot. One thing I immediately noticed- it’s WAY closer to the entrance than I thought. It’s probably different for every woman, but I’m a very small person (4’10”) so maybe I should’ve connected the dots that my gspot might be in a shallower spot. 

Well when I touched that part, it felt like I was touching my clit but from really deep. It was honestly a little bit jarring to feel the new sensation but I was excited about it, so I whipped out my seldom used rotating head dildo and had the craziest orgasm of my life. 

I’ve always felt like the sex gurus on Google or whatever was absolutely exaggerating when they say u can have a life changing orgasm from penetration but holy shit they were not lying. I think I came so hard that I experienced post nut clarity for the first time LOL. 

Also- this is besides the point but I’ve NEVER felt any sort of post orgasm clarity or feel any different besides maybe tired and satisfied. And it was WEIRD. I honestly felt a weird sense of doom and anxiety for like twenty minutes after the fact, but at the same time being euphoric and super out of it. 

All in all, I’m glad I learned something new about my body and I think I will have an easier time achieving penetrative orgasms from now on. Although, the post nut was too much for me to want to do it everyday.

My boyfriend (m23) and I (f23) have been dating for some 4 years. I love him and he is the light of my life. Nevertheless, I have always had this fantasy where I have sex with two men at once (it was just a fantasy).

Once when we were drunk, I had told my boyfriend that. He didn't say yes but he also didn't say no. Then on our 4 year anniversary, I managed to convince him that it would be nice to spice things up. I sort of talked him into it...I thought it would be fun and I wanted to try it.

Just for his comfort it was a random guy off of tinder. Initially the foreplay was great but then it went downhill from there... We were all just lying on the bed, having fun, but he started crying, we all stopped and he stepped outside for a second. He then tried and again but when the other guy was having sex with me from behind me and my boyfriend was sex from in front of me; he stopped, and said ""I can't do this"", and walked out. I stopped immediately, got dressed and we went home.

Since then, its been a month, and he won't even look at me. He cries every time I'm with him in a sexual way. I am so sorry I did this. I never intended to hurt him, I just wanted to have some fun. I clearly messed up but I can't be without him. I love him so much. How do I fix this?

Please help, I am crying. I don't want to lose him. He is the best thing that ever happened to me. He is the man of my dreams, and I will never ever bring this up again. The fantasy was nothing more than a fucked up idea, that is dead. I am very sorry but please help.",False

He sounds entitled to a blow job from a woman he barely knew, he’s fully aware that I may or not have liked getting my head pushed, and if anyones too nervous to do it, then shove her head down there? 

I told him that hookups arent an excuse to do whatever you want to people. I was hoping to discuss it so maybe he won’t do it to the next girl or at least ask. Literally blowjobs are one of my favorite things during sex, and its getting ruined…

He told me I should’ve “said it in the moment” instead of “acting like a past pretense pussy victim” and I “must be mad because” he “doesnt like me like that”. I cant wrap my head around how someone could say this. 

And I *did* tell him to stop it in the moment, I thought he’d recognize I was trying to pull away, but he kept pushing harder. I told him *out loud* to stop pushing my head down and yet he proceeded to face fuck me….. Stating my boundaries or expressing discomfort is not victimizing myself. Hes blocked on everything now.

Also he did not just “push my head down” he was pushing on it up and down forcing me to gag on it. That’s what bothers me the most.

She’s been picking at my boyfriend for about a month now and she told me she “can’t stop thinking about him” and wants a threesome cause sometimes I like to say how good my boyfriend is in bed. 

I don’t mind threesomes since I’ve done them before, but I am VERY possessive over my boyfriend. It’s been a fantasy of his but I’ve always immediately said no. After maturing/gaining trust in each other it’s been something I’m a little open to now. But now that it’s actually happening I feel a little annoyed with it already.

What annoys me is my boyfriend’s and best friend’s logic for this. My boyfriend said I can’t have a MMF threesome cause he’d get very jealous and doesn’t want me to have pleasure from another man. fair enough. He told me it’s never going to happen. He said I should enjoy a FFM threesome cause I’m bisexual. Yes, I am bisexual, but that literally has nothing to do with anything. Most girls who have threesomes aren’t bisexual and just put on a show for the dude. 

My best friend said if her boyfriend asked her for a threesome she’d feel insecure and self conscious. And she wouldn’t want to see him with another woman unless he really wanted it. Which is exactly how I feel about this situation.

I think I’m just agreeing to this because I’m a people pleaser. They planned it for tomorrow but I really don’t wanna go through with it anymore.

We recently had a baby and I’ve only just been cleared to resume normal physical (including sexual) activities.

The initial warning sign was that I was very unexcited about this. My partner had been talking about it for a couple of weeks and was very much looking forward to it. I was worried it was going to hurt and expressed this to my partner. 

Having a newborn has left us pretty tired, so it wasn’t until a couple of days after I was cleared that he tried having sex with me. Essentially, I was asleep and he started to touch me and try to take off my pants (note: no penetration occurred before I was fully conscious - and I know he would have stopped if I asked him to). This was something that happened a lot earlier in our relationship and it never bothered me, but last night I just didn’t feel into it. I went along with it anyway because I knew how much he was looking forward to us having sex again.

It was awkward and clunky. There were times it was uncomfortable and even painful for me, but he didn’t seem to notice. He finished and just collapsed back down into the bed and went to sleep. There was no foreplay, he pulled me onto my knees almost immediately because he can only cum in doggy, and he didn’t even cuddle me after.

I’ve been quite sore today and have had a little bit of bleeding. It stings when I pee, which I think is from damaged skin - he spent a decent amount of time trying to find my vagina and was jamming his penis into everywhere else.

Unfortunately, this isn’t unusual. I think our sex fell into that pattern quickly and I didn’t really notice until we had this big break from it. He’s never really been that “giving” in the sex department and he says that’s because I don’t orgasm vaginally. He says he knows he is great in bed and has never had trouble “getting previous partners to cum before.” Basically, sex is all about him cumming, and I’m really noticing the lack of intimacy in the lead up, during and after we have sex.

I don’t know how to bring this up with him without hurting his feelings or him becoming defensive. We’re not going to be in a position to “spice things up” for a little while as it’ll be a few months until our baby is in a more predictable sleep routine and we’re both pretty tired most of the time.

My bf and I are 17. We recently began to get sexual with each other. We used to just kiss but a few days ago I tried to escalate things. I started to rub him over his pants while we made out but after a little while he pulled away from the kiss and he was bright red. He told me that he had came in his pants. I told him that it was fine really. It was not a big deal. But he was just too embarrassed that he ended up just leaving my house. I texted him many times trying to assure him that he had nothing to be embarrassed about. Yesterday we met up again and the vibes were great. He started to rub my thighs and began kissing my neck. When I tried to lower my hands on him, he stopped me and said that he wanted to focus on me. So, he began to kiss me all over and I was really enjoying it. but then he stopped suddenly. He looked at me with the same expression he did a few days back. Bright red and embarrassed. After a while he left again :( I’ve been trying to text and call him, but he says he is too embarrassed. What do I even do? It doesn’t matter to me, and I’ve been trying to tell him that it’s fine but he just won’t budge. Do I just let him be and hope he would come back and talk?",False

Edit : If it helps he has low to none refraction period if that helps with anything

Edit : Thank you for lots of help we still are making a list and we are also planning stuff at least outside house and some stuff with my best friends too if that brings any idea.

Edit : Please stop messaging me about what I have there is an entire thread here, then it goes to pegging or cuckholding right away then suggesting the other right after. Not interesting in cuckholding or pegging.

Edit: Starting right now we have decided to start priming for him for the week and he's not allowed to cum and I've begun to start teasing him.

Edit : Because I am horny for my husband I am not horny for you. Please stop that I will just block you.

You often hear that porn sex is “not real,” but it seems to have a huge influence in shaping popular expectations, particularly amongst men. I realize that the answers here are possibly endless, but I’m curious to see if there are any core themes.

UPDATE:
Didn’t realize that this would be so popular!  I’ve read through all 300+ comments. Several actionable themes emerged.  Here is my summary:

1) Foreplay is important/necessary.  Porn tends to completely jump over this critical step in the sex process. Men need to budget meaningful time (>15 minutes?) to get getting their partners ready. 

2) Wash your hands and clean your finger nails. I was surprised how much this came up. Before you lay hands on a woman’s private parts she’s going to want to know that your hands are clean. Simple, straightforward, and obvious advice, but certainly not something porn highlights.

3) Err on the side of gentle. Porn would have you believe that women want aggressive clitoral stimulation that “looks like you’re trying to get out a stain,” as one person commented. For most women that just looks awfully painful. Same with fingering like you’re trying poke a wall in a wall. 

4) BJs don’t always have to come before sex. There is no set order that’s prescribed for every sexual encounter the way there is in porn. Be creative. 

5) Anal requires a lot of planning. Despite what porn often tells you, you can’t just jump from PIV to anal. It takes time, physical preparation — and lots and lots of lube. 

6) Choking isn’t mainstream. Yes, some couples enjoy aggressive sex, including choking, which is often depicted in porn, but it isn’t mainstream and you shouldn’t just automatically assume your partner wants and enjoys that.

7) Most sex positions are uncomfortable.  Experimenting with different sex positions can be fun, but porn often misrepresents how enjoyable performing many of them are. 

In summary, wash your hands, spend lots of time kissing and cuddling, be very gentle when you put your hands down her pants, don’t always expect a blowjob, stick to the basic positions, don’t be too aggressive — and whatever you do, don’t rush into anal!!",False

He at first lied and said he didn’t even know she was a prostitute and he just followed her because he was curious. After I kept asking him over and over, he finally admitted he was looking up prostitutes in our area and got curious to see what one looked like, so he followed her on his personal social media account. 

He claims he had no intention of doing anything inappropriate. 

I should add that we have not been having sex at all. He doesn’t want to with me hardly ever. This has been an ongoing problem for months and he claims he has an issue with low testosterone. 

He’s saying he was just fantasizing about getting with a prostitute and took it too far. 

I did more digging and found out she works at the local brothel and she also provides house calls and FaceTime/texting. It’s bothering me this happened while I was out of town. 

How do I handle this situation?

What's going on here? It's too late to ask her, so here we are.

&#x200B;

EDIT: First of all thank you all for all your responses, this has been wonderfully informational and great to hear all your personal feelings on this. The consensus seems to be that this is not uncommon among women, many of you expressed that you experience the same thing,. Also that the two sensations can be  distracting to one another, or that the owner of the clit just can't explain it. All fair answers to this. Thanks again all!

Okay it is way too hard to answer all the responses individually so here, get all birds stoned at once:

The woman I speak of in the post was my girlfriend, we broke up 7 years ago. It was my most cherished relationship and we loved eachother very much. Probably the best 2 years of my life.

I made it a goal of mine to learn her body as best I could and be able to give her whatever she wanted in bed, she was very open and honest and easy to talk to about sex, and we had amazing sex. But an old move I used on a previous girlriend of mine was to play with her clit while I boned her doggystyle and she loved it and the final year or so of that relationship, we had sex exclusively like that. I tried that on the new girlfriend and noticed that she did not respond at all the same as my other girlfriend had, and that's what I speak of in the post.

There was NOTHING that could be done to change what I am speaking of. No amount of wetness/lube or better/longer foreplay, or different/harder strokes or stroking patterns on her clit, no vibrator or toys, one in butt, no dirty talk, no talking about fuckin baseball, not me humming the star wars theme song while I was fucking her and playing with her clit wouldn't even change this, as sexy as that is :). It was simply the way her body was, and after thinking about it for about 24 I have a wild guess:

I think that when I was inside her maybe she would clench/shift do somethings with the muscles in and around her vagina and clit that would leave the clit in a state where it would not respond normally to touch. It could be subconscious and uncontrollable by her, and thus she just accepted that as the way she was. 

Just a guess really.

She has really only been with one person (her long-term partner now ex), whereas I’ve had multiple serious relationships as well as casual sexual partners. 

Recently there have been a numerous events where her insecurities act up and send her into anxious and depressive spirals when she realizes I can feel attracted to other women purely based on physical traits. During the most recent one, she literally stood up and left from a friendly gathering without saying goodbye, and she refused to talk about it for two days (I still don’t understand exactly what triggered it). 

Last night she told me that our relationship probably wouldn’t last because I have a physical “type”, which does not align to the way she sees herself, and that we are incompatible in the way we feel attracted to people. 

She told me that she has seen that I follow IG pages with women who have a very different body types as her (which she finds “disgusting” and makes her feel undesirable and insecure) and that she can’t bare the fact that I can feel attracted to women purely physical-based, while she can only feel attracted to people if she is also attracted to their personality. In her words this means that we don’t love in the same way and that I will never love her in the same way that she loves me. 

During this exchange she also basically shamed me not only about “lurking” watching other women on the internet who I “don’t even know”, but also about the casual sexual relationships I’ve had in my past, which she says she could never do unless she knew the person first.  

I’ve told her multiple times that the attraction she is talking about is probably the most baseline and carnal attraction one can have (one which seems pretty normal to me) and that it is completely compatible while also insignificant versus the attraction I feel for her and, in general, the attraction I have for my serious SO which, furthermore their physical traits, is due to my attraction to their personality.  

She says that otherwise I’m a really good boyfriend, that she is deeply in love with me, and doesn’t really want to end the relationship but that the above means that we probably won’t last because she wants a partner who only feels attraction the way she does. 

Even so, this has made me question and shame myself deeply. Is there a problem with me? Am I “disgusting” and “vulgar” for being okay about my purely physical sexual attraction? Is this just insecurities and lack of dating and sexual experience talking? While anyone can establish the deal breakers they want, is this a reasonable thing to want to end an otherwise healthy relationship?

A month and a half ago I had a sex accident. Heard a pop but didn’t experience loss of erection and had no symptoms of classic fractured penis so I didn’t go to ER.

There was very slight brusing a few days later and soreness but that’s it. 2 and a half weeks later and overnight, I developed a hard and tender area in middle of shaft. I did see a urologist this week and he said I likely did fracture it. My heart sank. Frustrating because I would have gone to ER that night if I had known that not all fractures look like the god awful purple penis pictures etc. I wish the literature out there online would reflect that.

Now when erect, my penis is all deformed, like totally done…and all ffed up. I have a hard painful lump halfway down the shaft that won’t go away and is tender to touch.

We've been together 1.5 years. We've estalibshed it's because of her responsive desire, e.g. once she is turned on it's fine and she's horny, but getting her turned on is the difficult part. She's made it very clear that she really enjoys sex with me and is always very wet etc, but getting her turned on is the part that I struggle with. She says to me that I need to turn her on properly and ""seduce her"". This is what confuses me.

The way I view initating sex would be starting with some cuddling or light touching, then light kissing, escalated into heavier kissing with more progressive touches and then sex happens. However, with her we rarely kiss/make out for longer than 5-10 seconds. This makes it increasingly difficult to progress anything physically.

Even if we are cuddling, I can do things like spank her, kiss her neck, cuddle her, touch her boobs, kiss her ear, lightly touch her vagina lips, stroke inner thighs, etc. All this stuff but a lot of the time it doesn't really make her wet or turn her on.

The times we do have sex I feel like it's just luck. Because I can do all these things and sometime won't work but other times it will work and nothing has changed.

I just want to know if I'm missing anything which would make sex happen more frequently because of my better ability to seduce her.

It's just frustrating because with my previous girlfriend this would work fine and I don't know what else I would do.

I do small things for her too outside of the bedroom, and am just a bit confused on how I am supposed to 'properly' seduce her.

I’d previously never gotten any complaints about head either, and would enthusiastically learn what other boyfriends liked and could make them finish within minutes if that was the goal. This guy though would tell me to be really rough (like *really* rough). He asked me to use teeth too, which no one has asked for before or since. I used teeth a bit and he said to be rougher so I was, then he snapped at me and said I took him too literally. When someone berates you and criticises you DURING sex… wow it hits differently. And completely killed the mood. 

There were quite a few more instances like that, basically where I was just made to feel shit and like I was the problem. And maybe I am, but I’d never ever felt like people had an issue with me before because we would work together and find what we each liked. Sex was FUN. When we met I was going through a particularly difficult break up and lost a lot of self esteem as it was, so my experience with him came at a bad time. 

Now, with my current partner (long distance), when I see him I find it incredibly hard to initiate being intimate out of fear that he won’t be satisfied. He loves going down and wants to eat me out but because of negative experiences with the other guy, my body language has ironically become so shy and awkward that it’s off putting because he is a gent and doesn’t want to pressure me when I’m clearly closed off. So he’s never gone down because I’m trapped in my shell and have said no when he tried. 

Also, unless I’m drunk (only time my confidence returns) I just feel so scared to do my usual antics. I won’t kiss passionately, I feel hyper aware of moaning, I won’t kiss his neck or down his body and tease him. All things I loved doing, because I’m so afraid of being cringey and embarrassing.  He is definitely quite a sensual person and I think if I did do those things he’d enjoy them. 

Any advice how I can break out of this fear? It’s been over a year and I still struggle a lot",False

I just mentioned gently how it’s a shame we don’t have sex like we used to and I feel like I miss it. Didn’t run him down, or insult him and was careful with the words I chose. He got so angry with me, like bordering on rage and said ‘if you don’t like it go get with someone that will fuck you more’ which to me is just passive aggressive, unhelpful and nasty.

He is refusing to wear condoms, won't get a vasectomy, doesn't want me on hormonal birth control, doesn't want me to get surgery or take time off work so that I can.  But wants unprotected sex and turns into a crabby jerk if I turn him down.  When I actually have unprotected sex with him he gets to the point and goes limp bc he's ""scared"" of pregnancy.  I am not scared of pregnancy and was ready to have another baby with him that we had discussed before he changed his mind about it.  When he goes limp I am usually already satisfied and I refuse to spend another 15 minutes to finish him off because I think he's the one making our sex life way too complicated and I just plain don't want to.  I'm tired, I'm done, and I feel like I'm already doing more than I should allow since he doesn't really want a baby, and I did my duty getting him to the point.  AITA?  He thinks I'm selfish because I am satisfied and he's not.  I think he's selfish because he is willing to risk having a baby he doesn't want.  His reasoning is he's old and doesn't want to have kids in the house too late in life.  He's over 40.",False

We both have some issues that can cause infertility so we are preparing for the possible outcome of having to try treatment or adoption to have children. We are attending genetics counseling and all that. Our last session with marital counseling (which I highly suggest, since, you don’t need marriage problems to be working on your marriage), we discussed the changes of life after having children. And last night we both realized that one thing we won’t be able to do whenever we want is have sex.

Neither me or my partner have ever heard or caught our parents in the act. When I was a children my mom have a hysterectomy in her early twenties and my logical 7 year old brain thought hysterectomy meant they removed her lady parts aka vagina. So until I was in my later teens I thought my parents didn’t have sex and my dad was a saint LMAO!
