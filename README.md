Naming convention for task 2: task2p1 + dataset_type(balnaced or imbalance) + model_type(there are 4 models) 

Naming convention for task 3: task3 + model_type(there are four of them)

Naming convention for reddit task 1: task1 + dataset_type(balnaced or imbalance) + model_type(there are 4 models) + reddit

Note: For the reddit task 1 XG Boost methods the naming convention is as follows task1 + XBBoost + reddit +balanced_imbalanced

Naming convention for task 2: task2p1 + dataset_type(balnaced or imbalance) + model_type(there are 4 models) +reddit
